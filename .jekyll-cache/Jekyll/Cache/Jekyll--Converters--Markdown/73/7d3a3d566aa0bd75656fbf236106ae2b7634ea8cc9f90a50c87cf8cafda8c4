<em>Multiple members of BAND participated in the NSF Project Scoping Workshop  <a href="https://a51.lbl.gov/~0nubb/nsf_0nubb/">Towards Precise and  Accurate Calculations of Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay</a>. The workshop took place on January 31  and February 1 over Zoom, and involved statisticians, computer scientists, and physicists working on calculations of neutrinoless double beta decay of nuclei. It was organized by Jon Engel, from  the University of North Carolina, together with BAND members Witek Nazarewicz and Daniel Phillips. A white paper summarizing the conclusions of the workshop is in preparation.

<em>The Second Annual BAND camp was a lot of fun. We had 47 particpants, 21 of whom attended in person. Talk .pdfs can be downloaded  <a href="https://indico.frib.msu.edu/event/47/timetable/#20211213">here</a>. Ozge Surer‚Äôs excellent tutorial on BFRESCOX is  available on <a href="https://github.com/bandframework/bandframework/blob/development/software/Bfrescox/Tutorial_I/BANDCamp21.rst">github</a>.

<em>Join the BAND team! The Ohio State University has a post-doc <a href="https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/20766">opening</a>. The successful candidate will  work effectively in an inter-disciplinary team to build a sustainable code base that can solve problems at the statistics-physics interface.  The position will focus on Bayesian modeling and methodology development for mixing multiple physics simulation models of nuclear dynamics, and building  scalable computational algorithms for inference, prediction and uncertainty quantification.

<em>The <a href="https://indico.frib.msu.edu/event/47/timetable/#20211213">schedule</a> for the Second Annual BAND Camp is now set! We are looking forward to  pedagogical presentations on BAND research by Frederi Viens, Ozge Surer, and Jordan Melendez. BAND leader Daniel Phillips will preview  BAND‚Äôs ‚Äúcomming attractions‚Äù. And we‚Äôll hear talks by recent Ph.D.s in this area who now work in the insurance industry.

<em>The paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01395-w">Precision mass measurement of light self-conjugate nucleus 80Zr</a> by BAND team member  Witek Nazarewicz and his experimental and theoretical collaborators has been published in Nature Physics. The journal selected the paper as a  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01443-5">highlight</a> pointing in particular to the use of one of the techniques at the heart of BAND,  Bayesian Model Averaging.
