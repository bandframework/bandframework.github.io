      <pubtit>Get on the BAND Wagon: A Bayesian Framework for Quantifying Model Uncertainties in Nuclear Dynamics</pubtit>

      <p>We describe the Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) framework,  a cyberinfrastructure that we are developing which will unify the treatment of nuclear models,  experimental data, and associated uncertainties.  We overview the statistical principles and nuclear-physics contexts underlying the BAND toolset, with an emphasis on Bayesian methodology‚Äôs ability to leverage insight from multiple models.  In order to facilitate understanding of these tools we provide a simple and accessible example of the BAND framework‚Äôs application.  Four case studies are presented to highlight how elements of the framework will enable progress on complex, far-ranging problems in nuclear physics.  By collecting notation and terminology, providing illustrative examples, and giving an overview of the associated techniques,  this paper aims to open paths through which the nuclear physics and statistics communities can contribute to and build upon the BAND framework.

      <p>A microscopic description of the interaction of atomic nuclei with external electroweak probes is required for elucidating  aspects of short-range nuclear dynamics and for the correct interpretation of neutrino oscillation experiments. Nuclear  quantum Monte Carlo methods infer the nuclear electroweak response functions from their Laplace transforms. Inverting the  Laplace transform is a notoriously ill-posed problem; and Bayesian techniques, such as maximum entropy, are typically used  to reconstruct the original response functions in the quasielastic region. In this work, we present a physics-informed  artificial neural network architecture suitable for approximating the inverse of the Laplace transform. Utilizing simulated,  albeit realistic, electromagnetic response functions, we show that this physics-informed artificial neural network outperforms  maximum entropy in both the low-energy transfer and the quasielastic regions, thereby allowing for robust calculations of  electron scattering and neutrino scattering on nuclei and inclusive muon capture rates.

      <p>We combine Newton‚Äôs variational method with ideas from eigenvector continuation to construct a fast &amp; accurate emulator  for two-body scattering observables. The emulator will facilitate the application of rigorous statistical methods for  interactions that depend smoothly on a set of free parameters.  When used to emulate the neutron-proton cross section with a modern chiral interaction as a function of 26 free parameters,  it reproduces the exact calculation with negligible error and provides an over 300x improvement in CPU time.

      <p>We assess the accuracy of Bayesian polynomial extrapolations from small parameter values to large ones. We employ Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to combine results from different order polynomials.  Our study considers two ‚Äútoy problems‚Äù where the underlying function used to generate data sets is known.  We use Bayesian parameter estimation to extract the polynomial coefficients and BMA different polynomial degrees  by weighting each according to its Bayesian evidence. We compare the predictive performance of this Bayesian Model Average with that of the individual polynomials.

      <p>We construct an efficient emulator for two-body scattering observables using the general (complex) Kohn  variational principle and trial wave functions derived from eigenvector continuation. The emulator simultaneously  evaluates an array of Kohn variational principles associated with different boundary conditions, which allows for the detection  and removal of spurious singularities known as Kohn anomalies. When applied to the K-matrix only, our emulator resembles the one constructed  by Furnstahl et al. (2020) although with reduced numerical noise. After a few applications to real potentials, we emulate differential  cross sections for 40Ca(n,n) scattering based on a realistic optical potential and quantify the model uncertainties using Bayesian methods. These  calculations serve as a proof of principle for future studies aimed at improving optical models.

      <p>Protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus move in shells analogous to the electronic shell structures of atoms.  The nuclear shell structure varies as a result of changes in the nuclear mean field with the number of neutrons N  and protons Z, and these variations can be probed by measuring the mass differences between nuclei. The N‚Äâ=‚ÄâZ‚Äâ=‚Äâ40  self-conjugate nucleus 80Zr is of particular interest, as its proton and neutron shell structures are expected to  be very similar, and its ground state is highly deformed. Here we provide evidence for the existence of a deformed  double-shell closure in 80Zr through high-precision Penning trap mass measurements of 80‚Äì83Zr. Our mass values show  that 80Zr is substantially lighter, and thus more strongly bound than predicted. This can be attributed to the  deformed shell closure at N‚Äâ=‚ÄâZ‚Äâ=‚Äâ40 and the large Wigner energy. A statistical Bayesian-model mixing analysis  employing several global nuclear mass models demonstrates difficulties with reproducing the observed mass anomaly  using current theory.

      <p>We explore the constraints on the three-nucleon force (3NF) of chiral effective field theory (ChiEFT) that are provided by bound-state observables in the A=3 and A=4 sectors. Our statistically rigorous  analysis incorporates experimental error, computational method uncertainty, and the uncertainty due to  truncation of the ChiEFT expansion at next-to-next-to-leading order. A consistent solution for the  3H binding energy, the 4He binding energy and radius, and the 3H beta-decay rate can only be obtained if  ChiEFT truncation errors are included in the analysis. The beta-decay rate is the only one of these that  yields a nondegenerate constraint on the 3NF low-energy constants, which makes it crucial for the parameter  estimation. We use eigenvector continuation for fast and accurate emulation of no-core shell model  calculations of the few-nucleon observables. This facilitates sampling of the posterior probability  distribution, allowing us to also determine the distributions of the parameters that quantify the truncation error.  We find a ChiEFT expansion parameter of Q=0.33 ¬± 0.06 for these observables.

      <p>Modern statistical tools provide the ability to compare the information content of observables and  provide a path to explore which experiments would be most useful to give insight into and constrain theoretical models. In this work we study three such tools, (i) the principal component analysis, (ii) the sensitivity analysis based on derivatives,  and (iii) the Bayesian evidence. This is done in the context of nuclear reactions with the goal of constraining the optical potential. We first apply these tools to a toy-model case. Then we consider two different reaction observables, elastic angular distributions and polarization data for reactions on 48Ca and 208Pb at two different beam energies. For the toy-model case, we find significant  discrimination power in the sensitivities and the Bayesian evidence, showing clearly that the volume imaginary term is more useful  to describe scattering at higher energies. When comparing between elastic cross sections and polarization data using realistic optical  models, sensitivity studies indicate that both observables are roughly equally sensitive but the variability of the optical model  parameters is strongly angle dependent. The Bayesian evidence shows some variability between the two observables, but the Bayes factor  obtained is not sufficient to discriminate between angular distributions and polarization.

      <p>Measurements from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) can be used to study the properties of quark-gluon plasma. Systematic constraints on these properties must combine measurements from different collision systems and methodically  account for experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Such studies require a vast number of costly numerical simulations. While computationally  inexpensive surrogate models (‚Äúemulators‚Äù) can be used to efficiently approximate the predictions of heavy ion simulations across a broad range of model parameters, training a reliable emulator remains a computationally expensive task. We use transfer learning to map the parameter dependencies of one model emulator onto another, leveraging similarities between different simulations of heavy ion collisions. By limiting the need for large  numbers of simulations to only one of the emulators, this technique reduces the numerical cost of comprehensive uncertainty quantification when  studying multiple collision systems and exploring different models.

      <p>For many decades now, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) has been a popular framework to systematically account for model uncertainty  that arises in situations when multiple competing models are available to describe the same or similar physical process. The implementation  of this framework, however, comes with a multitude of practical challenges including posterior approximation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo  and numerical integration. We present a Variational Bayesian Inference approach to BMA as a viable alternative to the standard solutions  which avoids many of the aforementioned pitfalls. The proposed method is ‚Äúblack box‚Äù in the sense that it can be readily applied to many  models with little to no model-specific derivation. We illustrate the utility of our variational approach on a suite of examples and discuss  all the necessary implementation details. Fully documented Python code with all the examples is provided as well.

      <p>We treat low-energy 3He-alpha elastic scattering  in an Effective Field Theory (EFT) that exploits the separation of scales in this reaction.  We compute the amplitude up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO), developing a hierarchy of the effective-range parameters that contribute  at various orders. We use the resulting formalism to analyze data for recent measurements at center-of-mass energies of 0.38-3.12 MeV using the  SONIK gas target at TRIUMF as well as older data in this energy regime. We employ a likelihood function that incorporates the theoretical  uncertainty due to truncation of the EFT and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to obtain the resulting posterior probability distribution.  We find that the inclusion of a small amount of data on the analysing power $A_y$ is crucial to determine the sign of the p-wave splitting in  such an analysis. The combination of Ay and SONIK data constrains all effective-range parameters up to O(p^4) in both s- and p-waves quite well.  The ANCs and s-wave scattering length are consistent with a recent EFT analysis of the capture reaction 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be.

      <p>The nuclear fission process is a dramatic example of the large-amplitude collective motion in which the nucleus undergoes a series of shape changes before splitting into distinct fragments. This motion can be represented by a pathway in the many-dimensional space of collective coordinates. Within  a stationary framework rooted in a static collective Schr√∂dinger equation, the collective action along the fission pathway determines the spontaneous  fission half-lives as well as mass and charge distributions of fission fragments. We study the performance and precision of various methods to  determine the minimum-action and minimum-energy fission trajectories in two- and three-dimensional collective spaces. These methods include the nudged  elastic band method (NEB), grid-based methods, and the Euler-Lagrange approach to the collective action minimization. The NEB method is capable of  efficient determination of the exit points on the outer turning surface that characterize the most probable fission pathway and constitute the key  input for fission studies. The NEB method will be particularly useful in large-scale static fission calculations of superheavy nuclei and neutron-rich  fissioning nuclei contributing to the astrophysical r-process recycling.

      <p>Correlations driven by the constraints of local charge conservationprovide insight into the chemical evolution and diffusivity of the high-temperature matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. Two-particle correlations driven by final-state interactions have allowed the extraction of critical femtoscopic space-time information about the expansion and dissolution of the same collisions. As first steps toward a Bayesian analysis of charge-balance functions, this study quantifies the contribution from final-state interactions, which needs to be subtracted in order to quantitatively infer the diffusivity and chemical evolution of the QGP. As seen in the figure, the correction from final-state interactions is small.

      <p>State-of-the-art hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions have considerable theoretical model uncertainties in the description of the  very early pre-hydrodynamic stage. We add a new computational module, KTIso, that describes the pre-hydrodynamic evolution kinetically,  based on the relativistic Boltzmann equation with collisions treated in the Isotropization Time Approximation. As a novelty, KTIso allows  for the inclusion and evolution of initial-state momentum anisotropies. To maintain computational efficiency KTIso assumes strict  longitudinal boost invariance and allows collisions to isotropize only the transverse momenta. We use it to explore the sensitivity  of hadronic observables measured in relativistic heavy-ion collisions to initial-state momentum anisotropies and microscopic scattering  during the pre-hydrodynamic stage.

      <p>The statistical correlations between nuclear deformations and charge radii of different nuclei are affected by the underlying shell structure. Even for well deformed and superfluid nuclei for which these observables change smoothly, the correlation range is rather short. This result suggests that the frequently made assumption of reduced statistical errors for the differences between smoothly-varying observables cannot be generally justified.

      <p>We develop a class of emulators for solving quantum three-body scattering problems based on combining the variational method for scattering observables and eigenvector continuation.  The emulators are first trained by the exact scattering solutions for a small number of parameter sets, and then employed to make interpolations and extrapolations in the parameter space.  Using a schematic nuclear-physics model with finite-range two and three-body interactions, we demonstrate the emulators to be extremely accurate and efficient.  The general strategies used here may be applicable for building the same type of emulators in other fields, wherever variational methods can be developed for evaluating physical models.  <br />

      <p>Phenomenological R-matrix has been a standard framework for the evaluation of resolved resonance cross section data in nuclear physics for many  years. It is a powerful method for comparing different types of experimental nuclear data and combining the results of many different experimental  measurements in order to gain a better estimation of the true underlying cross sections. Yet a practical challenge has always been the estimation  of the uncertainty on both the cross sections at the energies of interest and the fit parameters, which can take the form of standard level  parameters. In this work, the emcee Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler has been implemented for the R-matrix code AZURE2, creating the Bayesian  R-matrix Inference Code Kit (BRICK). Bayesian uncertainty estimation has then been carried out for a simultaneous R-matrix fit of a capture and scattering reaction in the 7Be system.

      <p>We use a recently developed Effective Field Theory (EFT) for rotational bands in odd-mass nuclei to perform a  Bayesian analysis of energy-level data in several nuclei. The error model in our Bayesian analysis includes both experimental  and EFT truncation uncertainties. It also accounts for the fact that low-energy constants (LECs) at even and odd orders have  different sizes. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to explore the joint posterior of the EFT and error-model parameters and show both can be  reliably determined. We extract the LECs up to fourth order in the EFT and find that, provided we correctly account for EFT truncation errors,  results for lower-order LECs are stable as we go to higher orders. LEC results are also stable with respect to the addition of higher-energy data. We find a clear correlation between the extracted and the expected value of the inverse breakdown scale.  The EFT turns out to converge markedly better than would be naively expected based on the scales of the problem

      <p>The field of model order reduction (MOR) is growing in importance due to its ability to extract the key insights from complex simulations while  discarding computationally burdensome and superfluous information. We provide an overview of MOR methods for the creation of fast &amp; accurate  emulators of memory- and compute-intensive nuclear systems, focusing on eigen-emulators and variational emulators. As an example, we describe  how ‚Äòeigenvector continuation‚Äô is a special case of a much more general and well-studied MOR formalism for parameterized systems. We continue  with an introduction to the Ritz and Galerkin projection methods that underpin many such emulators, while pointing to the relevant MOR theory  and its successful applications along the way. We believe that this guide will open the door to broader applications in nuclear physics and  facilitate communication with practitioners in other fields.

      <p>Breakup reactions are one of the favored probes to study loosely bound nuclei near the limits of stability.  In order to interpret such breakup experiments, the continuum discretized coupled channel method is typically used.  In this study, the first Bayesian analysis of a breakup reaction model is performed. We use a combination of statistical methods  together with a three-body reaction model to quantify the uncertainties on the breakup observables due to the parameters in the  effective potential describing the loosely bound projectile of interest. The combination of tools we develop opens the path for  a Bayesian analysis of a wide array of complex nuclear processes that require computationally intensive reaction models.

      <p>Bayesian model mixing (BMM) is a statistical technique that can be used to combine models that are predictive in different input domains into a composite distribution that has improved predictive power over the entire input space. We explore the application of BMM to the mixing of two expansions of a function of a coupling constant g that are valid at small and large values of g respectively. This type of problem is quite common in nuclear physics, where physical properties are straightforwardly calculable in strong and weak interaction limits or at low and high densities or momentum transfers, but difficult to calculate in between. Interpolation between these limits is often accomplished by a suitable interpolating function, e.g., Pad√© approximants, but it is then unclear how to quantify the uncertainty of the interpolant. We address this problem in the simple context of the partition function of zero-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory, for which the (asymptotic) expansion at small g and the (convergent) expansion at large g are both known. We consider three mixing methods: linear mixture BMM, localized bivariate BMM, and localized multivariate BMM with Gaussian processes. We find that employing a Gaussian process in the intermediate region between the two predictive models leads to the best results of the three methods. The methods and validation strategies we present here should be generalizable to other nuclear physics settings.

      <p>We present the results of a National Science Foundation Project Scoping Workshop, the purpose of which was to assess the current status of  calculations for the nuclear matrix elements governing neutrinoless double-beta decay and determine if more work on them is required. After  reviewing important recent progress in the application of effective field theory, lattice quantum chromodynamics, and ab initio nuclear-structure  theory to double-beta decay, we discuss the state of the art in nuclear-physics uncertainty quantification and then construct a  roadmap for work in all these areas to fully complement the increasingly sensitive experiments in operation and under development. The roadmap  includes specific projects in theoretical and computational physics as well as the use of Bayesian methods to quantify both intra- and inter-model  uncertainties. The goal of this ambitious program is a set of accurate and precise matrix elements, in all nuclei of interest to experimentalists,  delivered together with carefully assessed uncertainties. Such calculations will allow crisp conclusions from the observation or non-observation of  neutrinoless double-beta decay, no matter what new physics is at play.

      <p>We present the reduced basis method as a tool for developing emulators for equations with tunable parameters within the context of the nuclear  many-body problem. The method uses a basis expansion informed by a set of solutions for a few values of the model parameters and then projects  the equations over a well-chosen low-dimensional subspace. We connect some of the results in the eigenvector continuation literature to the  formalism of reduced basis methods and show how these methods can be applied to a broad set of problems. As we illustrate, the possible success  of the formalism on such problems can be diagnosed beforehand by a principal component analysis. We apply the reduced basis method to the  one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a harmonic trapping potential and to nuclear density functional theory for 48Ca, achieving  speed-ups of more than √ó150 and √ó250, respectively, when compared to traditional solvers. The outstanding performance of the approach, together  with its straightforward implementation, show promise for its application to the emulation of computationally demanding calculations, including  uncertainty quantification.

      <p>Proposed mechanisms for the production of calcium in the first stars that formed out of the matter of the Big Bang are at odds with observations. Advanced nuclear burning and supernovae were thought to be the dominant source of the calcium production seen in all stars. Here we suggest a qualitatively different path to calcium production: breakout from the ‚Äòwarm‚Äô carbon‚Äìnitrogen‚Äìoxygen (CNO) cycle. We report a direct experimental measurement of the 19F(p,‚ÄâŒ≥)20Ne breakout reaction down to a very low energy of 186‚Äâkiloelectronvolts, and characterize a key resonance at 225‚Äâkiloelectronvolts. For temperatures of astrophysical interest‚Äìaround 0.1‚Äâgigakelvin‚Äìthis thermonuclear 19F(p,‚ÄâŒ≥)20Ne rate is roughly a factor of seven larger than the previously recommended one. Our stellar models show a stronger breakout during stellar hydrogen burning than previously thought and may reveal the nature of calcium production in population‚ÄâIII stars imprinted on the oldest known ultra-iron-poor star, SMSS0313-67086. This experimental result was obtained in the China JinPing Underground Laboratory7, which offers an environment with an extremely low cosmic-ray-induced background. Our rate showcases the effect that faint population‚ÄâIII star supernovae can have on the nucleosynthesis observed in the oldest known stars and first galaxies, which are key mission targets of the James Webb Space Telescope.

      <p>A covariant energy density functional is calibrated using a principled Bayesian statistical  framework informed by experimental binding energies and charge radii of several magic and  semi-magic nuclei. The Bayesian sampling required for the calibration is enabled by the  emulation of the high-fidelity model through the implementation of a reduced basis method  (RBM)‚Äîa set of dimensionality reduction techniques that can speed up demanding calculations  involving partial differential equations by several orders of magnitude. The RBM emulator  we build‚Äîusing only 100 evaluations of the high-fidelity model‚Äîis able to accurately reproduce  the model calculations in tens of milliseconds on a personal computer, an increase in speed of  nearly a factor of 3,300 when compared to the original solver. Besides the analysis of the  posterior distribution of parameters, we present model calculations for masses and radii  with properly estimated uncertainties. We also analyze the model correlation between the  slope of the symmetry energy L and the neutron skin of 48Ca and 208Pb. The straightforward  implementation and outstanding performance of the RBM makes it an ideal tool for assisting  the nuclear theory community in providing reliable estimates with properly quantified  uncertainties of physical observables. Such uncertainty quantification tools will become  essential given the expected abundance of data from the recently inaugurated and future  experimental and observational facilities.

The term emulator refers here to a fast surrogate model capable of  reliably approximating high-fidelity models. As the general tools employed by these emulators are  not yet well-known in the nuclear physics community, we discuss variational and Galerkin projection  methods, emphasize the benefits of offline-online decompositions, and explore how these concepts  lead to emulators for bound and scattering systems that enable fast and accurate calculations using  many different model parameter sets. We also point to future extensions and applications of these  emulators for nuclear physics, guided by the mature field of model (order) reduction. All examples  discussed here and more are available as interactive, open-source Python code so that practitioners  can readily adapt projection-based emulators for their own work.

      <p>Gaussian process surrogates are a popular alternative to directly using computationally expensive  simulation models. When the simulation output consists of many responses, dimension-reduction  techniques are often employed to construct these surrogates. However, surrogate methods with dimension  reduction generally rely on complete output training data. This article proposes a new Gaussian process  surrogate method that permits the use of partially observed output while remaining computationally  efficient. The new method involves the imputation of missing values and the adjustment of the  covariance matrix used for Gaussian process inference. The resulting surrogate represents the available  responses, disregards the missing responses, and provides meaningful uncertainty quantification. The  proposed approach is shown to offer sharper inference than alternatives in a simulation study and a  case study where an energy density functional model that frequently returns incomplete output is  calibrated.

      <p>In nuclear reaction experiments, the measured decay energy spectra can give insights into the shell structure  of decaying systems. However, extracting the underlying physics from the measurements is challenging due to detector resolution and acceptance effects. The Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm, a deblurring method that is commonly  used in optics and has proven to be a successful technique for restoring images, was applied to our experimental  nuclear physics data. The only inputs to the method are the observed energy spectrum and the detector‚Äôs response matrix also known as the transfer matrix. We demonstrate that the technique can help access information about the  shell structure of particle-unbound systems from the measured decay energy spectrum that is not immediately accessible via traditional approaches such as œá-square fitting. For a similar purpose, we developed a machine learning model that uses a deep neural network (DNN) classifier to identify resonance states from the measured decay energy  spectrum. We tested the performance of both methods on simulated data and experimental measurements.  Then, we applied both algorithms to the decay energy spectrum of 26O‚Üí24O+n+n measured via invariant mass spectroscopy.  The resonance states restored using the RL algorithm to deblur the measured decay energy spectrum agree with those  found by the DNN classifier. Both deblurring and DNN approaches suggest that the raw decay energy spectrum of 26O exhibits three peaks at approximately 0.15 MeV, 1.50 MeV, and 5.00 MeV, with half-widths of 0.29 MeV, 0.80 MeV,  and 1.85 MeV, respectively.

      <p>Simulation models of critical systems often have parameters that need to be calibrated using observed data.  For expensive simulation models, calibration is done using an emulator of the simulation model built on simulation  output at different parameter settings. Using intelligent and adaptive selection of parameters to build the emulator  can drastically improve the efficiency of the calibration process. The article proposes a sequential framework with  a novel criterion for parameter selection that targets learning the posterior density of the parameters. The emergent  behavior from this criterion is that exploration happens by selecting parameters in uncertain posterior regions while  simultaneously exploitation happens by selecting parameters in regions of high posterior density. The advantages of  the proposed method are illustrated using several simulation experiments and a nuclear physics reaction model.
