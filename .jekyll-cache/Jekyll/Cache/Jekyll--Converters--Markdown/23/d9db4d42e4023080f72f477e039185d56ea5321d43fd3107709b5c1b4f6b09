<p>
Nuclear physicists seek an accurate description of the properties of atomic nuclei, collisions between nuclei, and extreme environments such as the first few seconds of our universe or the interior of a neutron star. These situations involve many particles interacting through complex forces. They‚Äôre each described by a number of different models: these typically do a good job of explaining the results of experiments that have already occurred. The models don‚Äôt do as well predicting what will happen in future experiments or in environments that are inaccessible here on Earth.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics</b> (BAND) Framework will use advanced statistical methods to produce forecasts for as-yet-unexplored situations that combine nuclear-physics models in an optimal way. These will be more reliable than the predictions of any individual model. BAND‚Äôs forefront computer codes will be widely available and will facilitate the design of nuclear-physics experiments that can deliver the largest gain in understanding. The adoption of BAND‚Äôs tools in other sciences dealing with ‚Äúmodel uncertainty‚Äù could spur broad scientific innovation. Undergraduate and graduate students working on BAND will gain a broad range of technical skills in data science, machine learning, nuclear physics, and high-performance computing.
