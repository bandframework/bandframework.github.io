    <h4>Daniel Phillips</h4>
    <p><i>Professor of Physics &amp; Astronomy, Ohio University<br />email: <a href="mailto:phillid1@ohio.edu">phillid1@ohio.edu</a></i></p>
    <p>Dr. Phillips has been applying Bayesian methods to nuclear-physics problems for more  than ten years. He is particularly interested in using Bayesian methods to quantify  the uncertainty in effective field theory (EFT) treatments of nuclear physics.  Together with Dick Furnstahl he founded the  <a href="https://buqeye.github.io/">BUQEYE collaboration</a>, which aims to use  statistical tools to answer fundamental problems in the construction and application  of EFTs, with particular attention to low-energy nuclear physics. This includes  Bayesian parameter estimation, model checking, model selection, and experimental design.  Phillips is the Principal Investigator of the BAND collaboration.

    <p>Dr. Heinz has been applying Bayesian methods for years to the calibration of large numerical models for the dynamical evolution of highly excited  forms of nuclear matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. His interests focus in particular on the quantitative extraction of information on the initial state and medium properties of quark-gluon plasma produced in such collisions. Within BAND he hopes to achieve unprecedented predictive power through full theoretical and experimental uncertainty quantification on quark-gluon plasma properties.

    <p>Dr. Nazarewicz is a nuclear theorist. His research invites a strong interaction between nuclear physics, many-body problem, high-performance computing, and statistics.  He has been applying statistical methods of uncertainty quantification to nuclear-physics problems for more than ten years. Most of his statistical work pertains to nuclear density functional theory. It includes various applications of parameter estimation, principal component analysis, correlation analysis, Bayesian model calibration, and model averaging and mixing - especially in the context of the science program of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at MSU.  He is particularly interested in using Bayesian model averaging and model mixing to quantify the uncertainty of nuclear models extrapolations.

    <p><i>Professor of Physics and FRIB Theory Alliance Managing Director, Michigan State University<br />email: <a href="mailto:nunes@frib.msu.edu">nunes@frib.msu.edu</a></i></p>
    <p>Dr. Nunes is interested in using reactions to address big questions in our field, such as where are the limits of stability, how does matter organize itself and where did heavy matter come from? While some of her work focuses on developing models for reactions with exotic unstable nuclei, another important theme relates to uncertainty quantification, model comparison and experimental design. The few-body methods used rely on effective potentials between constituents that are not well known and thus are the main source of uncertainty in current reaction models. Her group uses Bayesian statistical tools to quantify the uncertainty of the model predictions, to discriminate between models and help in identifying the optimum conditions for an experiment.

    <p>Dr. Pratt is a theoretical nuclear physicist specializing in the theory, phenomenology and modeling of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The main goal of Dr. Pratt‚Äôs research is to extract bulk properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by advancing theory and modeling, and comparing models to data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Lab and from the heavy ion program at the LHC. To that end, he has spearheaded efforts to develop strategies involving model emulators based on Bayesian statistics to constrain fundamental properties of the QGP, such as the equation of state, from experiment.

    <p>Dr. Viens‚Äôs core training is in probability theory and stochastic processes.  He has been applying Bayesian methods to many areas of science for more than twenty years,  from climate science, to agricultural economics, and to quantitative finance. In nuclear physics,  he is particularly interested in using Bayesian methods to assess the efficiency and honesty of  uncertainty quantification for extrapolating measurables in the nuclear landscape,  and to develop more efficient numerical implementations. Together with his MSU BAND colleagues,  he is working on systematic principles for Bayesian model mixing in the presence of varied nuclear  models, where improved predictive power is the goal. He is also interested in orienting his  BAND collaborators towards a data-informed framework of optimal experimental design based on  experiment costs, likelihood of discovery, impact of discovery, and risk preferences.  In his roles at MSU, Dr. Viens has helped operate and direct several educational and research  programs related to data science, including Actuarial Science, and Risk Analytics, the Data  Science MS program, the Center for Statistical Training and Consulting, and the Statistics department.  Viens is the lead co-PI at MSU for the BAND collaboration. At Rice University, he pursues his varied  other research interests, including stochastic analysis, financial mathematics, and applied statistics  in agro-ecology and paleoclimatology.
