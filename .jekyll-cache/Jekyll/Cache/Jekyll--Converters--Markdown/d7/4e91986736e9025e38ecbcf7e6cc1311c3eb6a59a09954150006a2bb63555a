<p>The BAND collaboration will carry out the software development in several stages that will include parallel lines of development and testing. External code delivery will happen via a <a href="https://github.com/bandframework/bandframework">public Github repository</a>. To suggest changes to these requirements or obtain more information, please contact members of <a href="https://bandframework.github.io/team">BAND</a>.</p>

<h2 id="including-code-in-band">Including code in BAND</h2>

<p>All code included in the public Github <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bandframework</code> repository will be open source.  If a piece of code does not contain a open-source LICENSE file as mentioned in the requirements below, then it will be automatically licensed as described in the LICENSE file in the root directory of the bandframework repository.</p>

<p>New code can be included in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bandframework</code> repository via a pull request to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">development</code> branch.  The name of the software should be the subdirectory name in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/software</code> directory.</p>

<p>BAND packages should include a compatibility document and a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bandframework/bandframework/main/resources/sdkpolicies/template.md">template</a> is provided. The compatibility  file should be placed in the root directory of the new subdirectory and labeled by the software name appended by SDKcompatibility.  For example, if you have a software <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code>, you should create a directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/software/foo</code> and place the compatibility file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fooSDKcompatibility.md</code> in the directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/software/foo</code> alongside contributed code.  All pull requests for inclusion of a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/software</code> directory  that do not include this document will be rejected.</p>

<h2 id="band-sdk-v01-community-policies">BAND SDK v0.1 Community Policies</h2>

<p>The BAND Framework will conform with BAND Software Development Kit (SDK) requirements, summarized below. By using such requirements we envision ready interoperability across the BANDIT software ecosystem, large-scale scientific simulation codes, and other numerical libraries.</p>
