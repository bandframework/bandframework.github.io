**BAND-Nuclear Data Workshop, December 2024**

The workshop will take place on Tuesday December 17 & Wednesday December 18. 

We will meet at the Dublin, OH campus of Ohio University (in <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/chsp/dublin-center/fewer-30-people">Room 245</a>), "the Dublin Integrated Education Center". 
Dublin is 25 minutes by car from Port Columbus International Airport (CMH). 

We have reserved a hotel room block at a rate of $99/night at the nearby Hilton Garden Inn, Dublin. The room block starts on Monday night, and goes through Thursday morning. You can call the hotel at 614-766-9900 and reference Ohio University Workshop or group code 90E. Or you can make a reservation online by using this <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/book/reservation/deeplink/?ctyhocn=CMHDHGI&groupCode=90E&arrivaldate=2024-12-16&departuredate=2024-12-19&cid=OM,WW,HILTONLINK,EN,DirectLink&fromId=HILTONLINKDIRECT">link</a>.

If in-person attendance is impossible for you then let's discuss you participating remotely and how it might work.
