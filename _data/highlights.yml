- title: Lightweight self-conjugate nucleus <sup>80</sup>Zr
  description: >
    This work provides evidence for the existence of a deformed double shell closure in <sup>80</sup>Zr 
    through high precision Penning trap mass measurements of <span style="white-space: nowrap"><sup>80-83</sup>Zr</span>.
    A statistical Bayesian model mixing analysis is used to interpret an observed mass anomaly.

- title: Fast &amp; accurate two-body scattering emulator
  description: >
    Bayesian analysis for experimental design often requires very many calculations with 
    different parameters, which is too expensive. Here we extend Eigenvector Continuation
    to create emulators that calculate two-body scattering observables directly (i.e., without needing wave functions).

- title: Two-body scattering emulator without Kohn anomalies
  description: >
    Fast &amp; accurate emulators are needed to perform Bayesian analyses for complex nuclear reactions. 
    We construct an emulator using Eigenvector Continuation applied to the (general) Kohn variational principle (KVP)
    that avoids Kohn anomalies.

- title: Local Bayesian Dirichlet mixing of imperfect models
  description: >
    To improve the predictability of complex computational 
    models in the experimentally-unknown domains, 
    we propose a Bayesian statistical machine learning  
    framework utilizing the Dirichlet distribution that 
    combines results of several imperfect  models.
