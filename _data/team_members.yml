     Dr. Furnstahl is a theoretical nuclear physicist specializing in the application of
     effective field theory (EFT) and renormalization group methods to low-energy nuclear
     structure and reactions. He has been applying Bayesian methods to nuclear-physics
     problems for many years.  Together with Daniel Phillips he founded the
     <a href="https://buqeye.github.io/">BUQEYE collaboration</a>, which aims to use
     statistical tools to answer fundamental problems in the construction and application
     of EFTs, with particular attention to low-energy nuclear physics. This includes Bayesian
     parameter estimation, model checking, model selection, and experimental design.

     Dr. Heinz has been applying Bayesian methods for years to the calibration of large
     numerical models for the dynamical evolution of highly excited  forms of nuclear
     matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. His interests focus in
     particular on the quantitative extraction of information on the initial state and
     medium properties of quark-gluon plasma produced in such collisions. Within BAND
     he hopes to achieve unprecedented predictive power through full theoretical and
     experimental uncertainty quantification on quark-gluon plasma properties.

     Dr. Nazarewicz is a nuclear theorist. His research invites a strong interaction between
     nuclear physics, many-body problem, high-performance computing, and statistics.  He has
     been applying statistical methods of uncertainty quantification to nuclear-physics
     problems for more than ten years. Most of his statistical work pertains to nuclear
     density functional theory. It includes various applications of parameter estimation,
     principal component analysis, correlation analysis, Bayesian model calibration, and
     model averaging and mixing - especially in the context of the science program of the
     Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at MSU.  He is particularly interested in using
     Bayesian model averaging and model mixing to quantify the uncertainty of nuclear models
     extrapolations.

     Dr. Nunes is interested in using reactions to address big questions in our field,
     such as where are the limits of stability, how does matter organize itself and where
     did heavy matter come from? While some of her work focuses on developing models for
     reactions with exotic unstable nuclei, another important theme relates to uncertainty
     quantification, model comparison and experimental design. The few-body methods used
     rely on effective potentials between constituents that are not well known and thus
     are the main source of uncertainty in current reaction models. Her group uses Bayesian
     statistical tools to quantify the uncertainty of the model predictions, to discriminate
     between models and help in identifying the optimum conditions for an experiment.

    Dr. Plumlee studies statistical methodology with a specific focus on uncertainty
    quantification for expensive computational models.  This includes the development
    and deployment of statistical learning tools in high dimensional environments.  
    Statistical procedures of scientific interest include model emulation, parameter

    large-scale implementations and well-justified uncertainty quantification of
    estimates.  Within BAND, his role will be in the design, use, and implementation of
    cutting edge statistical tools to solve complicated nuclear physics problems
    n the presence of multiple models.

     Dr. Pratola’s research program is focused on two areas of statistical methodology:
     (1) statistical models and methodology for calibrating complex simulation models to
     real-world observations for parameter estimation, prediction and uncertainty
     quantification; and (2) statistical models and methodology for computationally scalable
     and flexible Bayesian non-parametric regression models for high-dimensional "big data"
     and parallel computation.  His work is motivated by applied collaborations and has
     worked with researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Los Alamos

     Dr. Pratt is a theoretical nuclear physicist specializing in the theory, phenomenology
     and modeling of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The main goal of Dr. Pratt’s
     research is to extract bulk properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by advancing
     theory and modeling, and comparing models to data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion
     Collider at Brookhaven National Lab and from the heavy ion program at the LHC.
     To that end, he has spearheaded efforts to develop strategies involving model emulators
     based on Bayesian statistics to constrain fundamental properties of the QGP, such as
     the equation of state, from experiment.

        He has been applying Bayesian methods to many areas of science for more than twenty years, 
        from climate science, to agricultural economics, and to quantitative finance. In nuclear physics, 
        he is particularly interested in using Bayesian methods to assess the efficiency and honesty of 
        uncertainty quantification for extrapolating measurables in the nuclear landscape, 
        and to develop more efficient numerical implementations. Together with his MSU BAND colleagues, 
        he is working on systematic principles for Bayesian model mixing in the presence of varied nuclear 
        models, where improved predictive power is the goal. He is also interested in orienting his 
        BAND collaborators towards a data-informed framework of optimal experimental design based on 
        experiment costs, likelihood of discovery, impact of discovery, and risk preferences. 
        In his roles at MSU, Dr. Viens has helped operate and direct several educational and research 
        programs related to data science, including Actuarial Science, and Risk Analytics, the Data 
        Science MS program, the Center for Statistical Training and Consulting, and the Statistics department.
