     Boyana Norris  is currently an Associate Professor at the 
     Department of Computer and Information Science at the University 
     of Oregon. Her research in high-performance computing (HPC) 
     focuses on methodologies and tools for performance reasoning and 
     automated optimization of scientific applications, while ensuring 
     continued or better usability of HPC tools and libraries and 
     improving developer productivity. She has coauthored over 
     100 peer-reviewed publications on topics including performance 
     modeling, automated performance optimization (autotuning) 
     of parallel scientific applications, embedding of domain-specific 
     languages into legacy codes, source-transformation-based automatic 
     differentiation, adaptive algorithms for HPC, component-based 
     software engineering for HPC, and taxonomy-based approaches to 
     learning and using HPC libraries.
