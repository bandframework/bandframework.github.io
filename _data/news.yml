     Edgard Bonilla, Kyle Godbey, and BAND post-doc Pablo Giuliani are co-authors on two recent publications that employ Reduced Basis Methods (RBM) to speed up the calibration and evaluation of density functionals. In <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.106.054322">Training and projecting: a reduced basis method for many-body physics</a> they and collaborator Dean Lee lay out the foundation of the method and demonstrate its potential in some simple examples. In <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2022.1054524">Bayes goes fast: Uncertainty quantification for a covariant energy density functional emulated by the reduced basis method</a> Bonilla, Godbey, and Giuliani teamed up with BAND member Frederi Viens and Jorge Piekarewicz to calibrate a relativistic energy density functional using a fraction of the computational resources that would have been needed without RBM.

     The paper <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.106.044002">Interpolating between small- and large-g expansions using      Bayesian model mixing</a> written by BAND members Alexandra Semposki, Dick Furnstahl, and Daniel Phillips has been published in Phys. Rev. C. It tests BAND's linear, bivariate, and multivariate model mixing approaches on a toy model and paves the way for applications to crucial nuclear physics problems in the very near future!

     BAND has released <a href="https://github.com/bandframework/bandframework">v0.2 of our software framework</a>! This release includes two "BAND tools" 
     intended to facilitate Bayesian analyses: surmise for model emulation & calibration and SaMBA for model mixing. It also includes three "BAND examples" 
     where we apply these tools and methods to forefront Nuclear Physics problems: BFRESCOX for coupled-channel analyses of nuclear reactions, BRICK for 
     R-matrix calculations, and a tutorial (QGP_Bayes) on the use of JETSCAPE_SIMS tools to analyze the quark-glion plasma. Pull the repo to get all of them, 
     or pull some of it to get particular pieces you want, but please go ahead and play and tell us what you think when you do!

    Multiple members of BAND participated in the NSF Project Scoping Workshop 
    <a href="https://a51.lbl.gov/~0nubb/nsf_0nubb/">Towards Precise and 
    Accurate Calculations of Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay</a>. The workshop took place on January 31 
    and February 1 over Zoom, and involved statisticians, computer scientists, and physicists working
    on calculations of neutrinoless double beta decay of nuclei. It was organized by Jon Engel, from 
    the University of North Carolina, together with BAND members Witek Nazarewicz and Daniel Phillips.
    A white paper summarizing the conclusions of the workshop is in preparation.
