  image: flowchart_tikz_paper_truncated.png
  description: >
    We describe the Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) framework, 
    a cyberinfrastructure that we are developing which will unify the treatment of nuclear models, 
    experimental data, and associated uncertainties. 
    We overview the statistical principles and nuclear-physics contexts underlying the BAND toolset,
    with an emphasis on Bayesian methodology's ability to leverage insight from multiple models. 
    In order to facilitate understanding of these tools we provide a simple and accessible example of the BAND framework's application. 
    Four case studies are presented to highlight how elements of the framework will enable progress on complex, far-ranging problems in nuclear physics. 
    By collecting notation and terminology, providing illustrative examples, and giving an overview of the associated techniques, 
    this paper aims to open paths through which the nuclear physics and statistics communities can contribute to and build upon the BAND framework.

- title: "From chiral EFT to perturbative QCD: A Bayesian model mixing approach to symmetric nuclear matter"
  image: joint_subplot_curvewise_priors.PNG
  description: >
    Constraining the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting, dense matter is the focus of intense experimental, observational, and theoretical effort. Chiral effective field theory (ChEFT) can describe the EOS between the typical densities of nuclei and those in the outer cores of neutron stars while perturbative QCD (pQCD) can be applied to properties of deconfined quark matter, both with quantified theoretical uncertainties. However, describing the full range of densities in between with a single EOS that has well-quantified uncertainties is a challenging problem. Bayesian multi-model inference from ChEFT and pQCD can help bridge the gap between the two theories. In this work, we introduce a correlated Bayesian model mixing framework that uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to assimilate different information into a single QCD EOS for symmetric nuclear matter. The present implementation uses a stationary GP to infer this mixed EOS solely from the EOSs of ChEFT and pQCD while accounting for the truncation errors of each theory. The GP is trained on the pressure as a function of number density in the low- and high-density regions where ChEFT and pQCD are, respectively, valid. We impose priors on the GP kernel hyperparameters to suppress unphysical correlations between these regimes. This, together with the assumption of stationarity, results in smooth ChEFT-to-pQCD curves for both the pressure and the speed of sound. We show that using uncorrelated mixing requires uncontrolled extrapolation of at least one of ChEFT or pQCD into regions where the perturbative series breaks down and leads to an acausal EOS. We also discuss extensions of this framework to non-stationary and less differentiable GP kernels, its future application to neutron-star matter, and the incorporation of additional constraints from nuclear theory, experiment, and multi-messenger astronomy.

  image: vi_ptmc_posteriors.png
  description: >
    Two different methods, Monte Carlo sampling and variational inference (VI), were used for Bayesian calibration of the effective-range parameters       in 3He–4He elastic scattering. The parameters were calibrated to data from a recent 3He–4He elastic scattering differential cross section              experiment. Analysis of these data for Elab ≤ 4.3 MeV yields a unimodal posterior for which both methods obtain the same structure. However, the       effective-range expansion amplitude does not account for the 7/2− state of 7Be so, even after calibration, the description of data at the upper        end of this energy range is poor. The data up to Elab = 2.6 MeV can be well described, but calibration to this lower-energy subset of the data         yields a bimodal posterior. After adapting VI to treat such a multi-modal posterior we find good agreement between the VI results and those            obtained with parallel-tempered Monte Carlo sampling.

- title: "An active learning performance model for parallel Bayesian calibration of expensive simulations"
  image: Figure_WS_2.jpg
  description: >
        Estimating parameters of simulation models based on observed data is an especially challenging task
        when the computational expense of the model -- necessitated by faithfully capturing the real 
        system -- limits the learning process. When simulation models are expensive to evaluate, 
        emulators are often built to efficiently approximate model outputs during model calibration. 
        Computing-informed active learning, guided by intelligent acquisition functions, can improve 
        data collection for emulators, thereby enhancing the calibration's efficiency. 
        However, the performance of active learning strategies depends on computational factors 
        such as computing environment (e.g., parallel resources available), tradeoffs in 
        (calibration and simulation) algorithm's ability to benefit from parallelism, and 
        the computational expense of the simulation models. In addition to overviewing these 
        considerations, this work provides examples exemplifying the tradeoffs that make such learning difficult.

  image: nsat_figure.png
  description: >
        The equation of state (EOS) in the limit of infinite symmetric nuclear matter exhibits 
        an equilibrium density at which the pressure vanishes and the energy per 
        particle attains its minimum. Although not directly measurable, the nuclear 
        saturation point (𝑛0,𝐸0) can be extrapolated by density-functional theory (DFT), providing 
        tight constraints for microscopic interactions derived from chiral effective-field theory 
        (EFT). We present a Bayesian mixture 
        model that combines multiple DFT predictions for (𝑛0,𝐸0) using an efficient conjugate prior 
        approach. The inferred posterior distribution for the saturation point's mean and 
        covariance matrix follows a normal-inverse-Wishart (NIW) class, resulting in posterior 
        predictives in the form of correlated, bivariate 𝑡 distributions. The DFT uncertainty 
        reports are then used to mix these posteriors using an ordinary Monte Carlo approach. 
        Our Bayesian framework is publicly available, 
        so practitioners can readily use and extend our results.

- title: "Simulation experiment design for calibration via active learning"
  image: seq_des.png
  description: >
        Simulation models often have parameters as input and return outputs to understand the behavior of complex 
        systems. Calibration is the process of estimating the values of the parameters in a simulation model in 
        light of observed data from the system that is being simulated. When simulation models are expensive, 
        emulators are built with simulation data as a computationally efficient approximation of an expensive model. 
        An emulator then can be used to predict model outputs, instead of repeatedly running an expensive simulation 
        model during the calibration process. Sequential design with an intelligent selection criterion can guide 
        the process of collecting simulation data to build an emulator, making the calibration process more efficient 
        and effective. This article proposes two novel criteria for sequentially acquiring new simulation data in an 
        active learning setting by considering uncertainties on the posterior density of parameters. Analysis of several 
        simulation experiments and real-data simulation experiments from epidemiology demonstrates that proposed approaches 
        result in improved posterior and field predictions.

- title: "Model orthogonalization and Bayesian forecast mixing via principal component analysis"
  image: PCABMC.png
  description: >
        One can improve predictability in the unknown domain by combining forecasts of imperfect complex
        computational models using a Bayesian statistical machine learning framework. In many cases, however, the
        models used in the mixing process are similar. In addition to contaminating the model space, the existence of
        such similar, or even redundant, models during the multimodeling process can result in misinterpretation of
        results and deterioration of predictive performance. In this paper we describe a method based on the principal
        component analysis that eliminates model redundancy. We show that by adding model orthogonalization to
        the proposed Bayesian model combination framework, one can arrive at better prediction accuracy and reach
        excellent uncertainty quantification performance.

        Uncertainty quantification using Bayesian methods is a growing area of research. Bayesian model mixing (BMM) 
        is a recent development which combines the predictions from multiple models such that the fidelity of each model 
        is preserved in the final result. Practical tools and analysis suites that facilitate such methods are therefore 
        needed. Taweret1 introduces BMM to existing Bayesian uncertainty quantification efforts. Currently, Taweret 
        contains three individual Bayesian model mixing techniques, each pertaining to a different type of problem 
        structure; we encourage the future inclusion of user-developed mixing methods. Taweret’s first use case is 
        in nuclear physics, but the package has been structured such that it should be adaptable to any research 
        engaged in model comparison or model mixing.

  image: cat_plot.png
  description: >
        A new generation of phenomenological optical potentials requires robust calibration and uncertainty quantification, 
        motivating the use of Bayesian statistical methods. These Bayesian methods usually require 
        calculating observables for thousands or even millions of parameter sets, making fast and accurate 
        emulators highly desirable or even essential. Emulating scattering across different energies or 
        with interactions such as optical potentials is challenging because of the nonaffine parameter 
        dependence, meaning the parameters do not all factorize from individual operators. Here we introduce 
        and demonstrate the reduced-order scattering emulator (ROSE) framework, a reduced basis emulator 
        that can handle nonaffine problems. ROSE is fully extensible and works within the publicly available BAND framework software suite.
        As a demonstration problem, we use ROSE to calibrate a realistic nucleon-target scattering model through the calculation of elastic 
        cross sections. This problem shows the practical value of the ROSE framework for Bayesian uncertainty quantification with controlled 
        trade-offs between emulator speed and accuracy as compared to high-fidelity solvers.

        We show the system of a heavy charged particle and a neutral atom can be described by a low-energy effective field 
        theory where the attractive 1/r^4 induced dipole potential determines the long-distance, low-energy wave functions.
        The 1/r^4 interaction is renormalized by a contact interaction at leading order. Derivative corrections to 
        that contact interaction give rise to higher-order terms. We show that this “induced-dipole EFT” (ID-EFT) reproduces
        the π+-hydrogen phase shifts of a more microscopic potential, the Temkin-Lamkin potential, over a wide range of
        energies. Already at leading order it also describes the highest-lying excited bound states of the pionic-hydrogen 
        ion. Lower-lying bound states receive substantial corrections at next-to-leading order, with the size of the
        correction proportional to their distance from the scattering threshold. Our next-to-leading order calculation show
        that the three highest-lying bound states of the Temkin-Lamkin potential are well described in ID-EFT.

         Solar neutrino measurements have recently reached a level of sensitivity such that CNO fluxes can now be

         detection of neutrinos from the β+ decay of 13N from the 12C(p,gamma)13N  reaction. This paper reports on a recent
         measurement of this  reaction covering a broad laboratory energy range between 1.0 and 2.5 MeV. This work takes

  description: >
         We introduce a flexible Bayesian model mixing methodology using tree basis functions.  
         In modern computer experiment applications, one often encounters the situation where various 
         models of a physical system are considered, each implemented as a simulator on a computer. 
         An important question in such a setting is determining the best simulator, or the best 
         combination of simulators, to use for prediction and inference. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) 
         and stacking are two statistical approaches used to account for model uncertainty by 
         aggregating a set of predictions through a simple linear combination or weighted average, 
         but this ignores the localized behavior of each simulator. This paper proposes a BMM model 
         based on Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) which has the desired flexibility to 
         capture each simulators local behavior. The proposed methodology is applied to combine 
         predictions from Effective Field Theories (EFTs) associated with a motivating nuclear physics 
         application.

  description: >
         Due to large pressure gradients at early times, standard hydrodynamic model simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions 
         do not become reliable until O(1)fm/c after the collision. To address this one often introduces a pre-hydrodynamic stage that
         models the early evolution microscopically, typically as a conformal, weakly interacting gas. In such an approach the transition
         from the pre-hydrodynamic to the hydrodynamic stage is discontinuous, introducing considerable theoretical model ambiguity. 
         Alternatively, fluids with large anisotropic pressure gradients can be handled macroscopically using the recently developed 
         Viscous Anisotropic Hydrodynamics (VAH). In high-energy heavy-ion collisions VAH is applicable already at very early times, 
         and at later times transitions smoothly into conventional second-order viscous hydrodynamics (VH). We present a Bayesian calibration
         of the VAH model with experimental data for Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC. We find that the VAH model has the unique capability of

  description: >
      Simulation models of critical systems often have parameters that need to be calibrated using observed data. 
      For expensive simulation models, calibration is done using an emulator of the simulation model built on simulation 
      output at different parameter settings. Using intelligent and adaptive selection of parameters to build the emulator 
      can drastically improve the efficiency of the calibration process. The article proposes a sequential framework with 
      a novel criterion for parameter selection that targets learning the posterior density of the parameters. The emergent 
      behavior from this criterion is that exploration happens by selecting parameters in uncertain posterior regions while 
      simultaneously exploitation happens by selecting parameters in regions of high posterior density. The advantages of 
      the proposed method are illustrated using several simulation experiments and a nuclear physics reaction model.

  description: >
      In nuclear reaction experiments, the measured decay energy spectra can give insights into the shell structure 
      of decaying systems. However, extracting the underlying physics from the measurements is challenging due to detector
      resolution and acceptance effects. The Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm, a deblurring method that is commonly 
      used in optics, was applied to our experimental nuclear physics data. The only inputs to the method are the observed 
      energy spectrum and the detector's response matrix. We demonstrate that the technique can help access information about the 
      shell structure of particle-unbound systems from the measured decay energy spectrum that is not immediately
      accessible via traditional approaches such as χ-square fitting. For a similar purpose, we developed a deep neural 
      network (DNN) classifier to identify resonance states from the measured decay energy 
      spectrum. We tested the performance of both methods on simulated data and experimental measurements. 
      Then, we applied both algorithms to the decay energy spectrum of 26O→24O+n+n measured via invariant mass spectroscopy. 
      The resonance states restored using the RL algorithm to deblur the measured decay energy spectrum agree with those 
      found by the DNN classifier. Both approaches suggest that the raw decay energy spectrum of
      26O exhibits three peaks at approximately 0.15 MeV, 1.50 MeV, and 5.00 MeV, with half-widths of 0.29 MeV, 0.80 MeV,

      Gaussian process surrogates are a popular alternative to directly using computationally expensive 
      simulation models. When the simulation output consists of many responses, dimension-reduction

      surrogate method that permits the use of partially observed output while remaining computationally 
      efficient. The new method involves the imputation of missing values and the adjustment of the 
      covariance matrix used for Gaussian process inference. The resulting surrogate represents the available 
      responses, disregards the missing responses, and provides meaningful uncertainty quantification. The 
      proposed approach is shown to offer sharper inference than alternatives in a simulation study and a 
      case study where an energy density functional model that frequently returns incomplete output is 
      calibrated.

  description: >
      The BUQEYE collaboration (Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification: Errors in Your effective field theory) 
      presents a pedagogical introduction to projection-based, reduced-order emulators for applications 
      in low-energy nuclear physics. The term emulator refers here to a fast surrogate model capable of 
      reliably approximating high-fidelity models. As the general tools employed by these emulators are 
      not yet well-known in the nuclear physics community, we discuss variational and Galerkin projection 
      methods, emphasize the benefits of offline-online decompositions, and explore how these concepts 
      lead to emulators for bound and scattering systems that enable fast and accurate calculations using 
      many different model parameter sets. We also point to future extensions and applications of these 
      emulators for nuclear physics, guided by the mature field of model (order) reduction. All examples 
      discussed here and more are available as interactive, open-source Python code so that practitioners 
      can readily adapt projection-based emulators for their own work.

  description: >
      A covariant energy density functional is calibrated using a principled Bayesian statistical 
      framework informed by experimental binding energies and charge radii of several magic and 
      semi-magic nuclei. The Bayesian sampling required for the calibration is enabled by the 
      emulation of the high-fidelity model through the implementation of a reduced basis method 
      (RBM)—a set of dimensionality reduction techniques that can speed up demanding calculations 
      involving partial differential equations by several orders of magnitude. The RBM emulator 
      is able to accurately reproduce the model calculations in tens of milliseconds on a personal computer, 
      an increase in speed of nearly a factor of 3,300. Besides the analysis of the 
      posterior distribution of parameters, we present model calculations for masses and radii 
      with properly estimated uncertainties. We also analyze the model correlation between the 
      slope of the symmetry energy L and the neutron skin of 48Ca and 208Pb.

  image: copulas.jpg
  description: >
      With the advancements of computer architectures, the use of computational models proliferates to solve complex
      problems in many scientific applications such as nuclear physics and climate research. However, the potential of such 
      models is often hindered because they tend to be computationally expensive. We develop a 
      computationally efficient algorithm based on variational Bayes inference (VBI) for calibration of computer models with
      Gaussian processes. Unfortunately, the standard fast-to-compute gradient estimates based on subsampling are biased 
      under the calibration framework due to the conditionally dependent data which diminishes the efficiency of VBI. In 
      this work, we adopt a pairwise decomposition of the data likelihood using vine copulas that separate the information 
      on dependence structure in data from their marginal distributions and leads to computationally efficient gradient 
      estimates that are unbiased and thus scalable calibration. We provide empirical evidence for the computational 
      scalability of our methodology together with average case analysis and all the necessary details for an 
      efficient implementation of the proposed algorithm. We also demonstrate the opportunities given by our method for 
      practitioners on a real data example through calibration of the Liquid Drop Model of nuclear binding energies.

  image: brick.jpg
  description: >
    The modeling of background sources in large volume detection systems
    requires accurate nuclear cross sections for a variety of reactions. Among
    the most important are ( α , n ) on light nuclei, where α particles, up to ≈
    9 MeV, are produced from the decay of actinides present in trace amounts in
    detection and structural material. In order to model the neutron energy
    spectra and production of other secondary particles, the partial cross
    sections are needed. Yet very little experimental data exists for these
    partial cross sections because past measurements, hampered by the
    experimental challenges of neutron detection, have focused mostly on total
    reaction cross section measurements. Here the partial cross section of the 
    13 C ( α , n 1 ) 16 O reaction is reported for the first time. The
    measurements were made near the reaction threshold using a high energy
    resolution helium spectrometer. The measurements show a rapidly increasing
    cross section, which quickly becomes a significant fraction of the total
    reaction cross section. Measurements are compared with previous theory
    estimates and differences of more than an order of magnitude are found. A
    comparison is made with new total cross section measurements and the current
    level of consistency is demonstrated.

  description: >
    Fluorine is one of the most interesting elements in nuclear astrophysics.
    The 19F(p,α)16O reaction is of astrophysical importance in
    addressing fluorine abundances in the universe and CNO material loss in the
    first generation stars. As a day-1 campaign in the Jinping Underground
    Nuclear Astrophysics experiment facility (JUNA), we report the full direct
    measurement results of the 19F(p,αγ)16O reaction, which is one of
    the important channels in the 19F(p,α)16O reaction. The γ-ray
    yields were measured over a center-of-mass energy range of Ec.m.=72.4–344
    keV, covering the astrophysical Gamow window. The measurement has reached
    down to an unprecedentedly low energy of 72.4 keV. The experiment was
    performed under the extremely low cosmic-ray-induced background environment
    of the China JinPing underground Laboratory (CJPL), one of the deepest
    underground laboratories in the world (2400 m). The astrophysical S factors
    in the energy region of 72.4–188.8 keV have been derived experimentally for
    the first time. The present low-energy astrophysical S factors deviate
    significantly from previous theoretical predictions, and the associated
    uncertainties are remarkably reduced. The thermonuclear 19F(p,αγ)16O rate
    has been determined down to a low temperature of ≈ 0.05 GK, for
    astrophysical modeling, based on a firmer experimental basis.  Furthermore,
    the present work shows that the contribution owing to the (p,α0)
    channel dominates the total (p,α) rate over the entire low temperature
    region below 0.12 GK, clarifying the role these two channels contributing to
    the total rate.

  image: brick.jpg
  description: >
    Proposed mechanisms for the production of calcium in the first stars
    that formed out of the matter of the Big Bang are at odds with observations. Advanced nuclear burning and
    supernovae were thought to be the dominant source of the calcium production
    seen in all stars. Here we suggest a qualitatively different path to
    calcium production: breakout from the ‘warm’ carbon–nitrogen–oxygen
    (CNO) cycle. We report a direct experimental measurement of the 19F(p, γ)20Ne
    breakout reaction down to a very low energy of 186 kiloelectronvolts,
    and characterize a key resonance at 225 kiloelectronvolts. For temperatures of
    astrophysical interest--around 0.1 gigakelvin--this thermonuclear
    19F(p, γ)20Ne rate is roughly a factor of seven larger than the previously
    recommended one. Our stellar models show a stronger breakout during
    stellar hydrogen burning than previously thought and may reveal the
    nature of calcium production in population III stars imprinted on the oldest
    known ultra-iron-poor star, SMSS0313-67086. This experimental result was
    obtained in the China JinPing Underground Laboratory7, which offers an
    environment with an extremely low cosmic-ray-induced background. Our rate
    showcases the effect that faint population III star supernovae can have on
    the nucleosynthesis observed in the oldest known stars and first galaxies,
    which are key mission targets of the James Webb Space Telescope.

  description: >
    The 23 Na (p,γ)24Mg reaction plays an important role in the
    nucleosynthesis of elements in the hot bottom burning environment of
    asymptotic giant branch stars by providing a breakout path from the NeNa
    cycle to the MgAl cycle. At temperatures above ≈ 0.06 GK, the underlying
    nuclear reaction contributions to the rate are primarily narrow resonances,
    but at lower temperatures direct and broad resonance tail contributions come
    to dominate. While there have been recent studies to improve the
    uncertainties associated with these narrow resonances, little attention has
    been paid to the nonresonant component. In this work, experimental
    measurements are reported over the energy range from 0.5 and 1.05 MeV proton
    beam energy, with a focus on studying the off-resonance region of the cross
    section. Several transitions were observed where two broad resonances
    dominate the energy range and whose low energy tails contribute strongly to
    the low-energy, nonresonant, cross section. In addition, a clear signature
    of direct capture has been observed for the first time in the 23Na(p,γ)24Mg
    reaction.

  description: >
    A multitude of broad interfering resonances characterize the 10B(p,α)7Be
    cross section at low energies. The complexity of the reaction mechanism, as
    well as conflicting experimental measurements, have so far prevented a
    reliable prediction of the cross section over the energy ranges pertinent
    for a boron-proton fusion reactor environment. Purpose: To improve the
    evaluated cross section of the 10B(p,α)7Be reaction, this study
    targets the proton energy region from 0.8 to 2.0 MeV, where kinematic
    overlap of the scattered protons and reaction α particles have made past
    measurements very challenging. Method: New detailed studies of the reaction
    have been performed at the Edwards Accelerator Laboratory at Ohio University
    and the Nuclear Science Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame using
    time-of-flight and degrader foil techniques, respectively. Results: Proton
    and α -particle signals were clearly resolved using both techniques, and 16
    point differential cross sections were measured over an angular range of θ
    lab = 45º and 157.5º. A comprehensive R-matrix analysis of the
    experimental data, including data from previous low-energy studies of the
    10B(p,α)7Be, 10B(p,p)10B, and 10B(p,γ)11C reactions, was achieved over
    the region of measurement. Using a representative set of previous data, the
    fit was extended to very low energies.
    Conclusions: On the basis of this
    data and R-matrix analysis, a more reliable and consistent description of
    the 10B(p,α)7Be cross section has been established. The uncertainty
    over the energy range of this study has been reduced from ≈20 % to ≈10 %,
    and the level structure over this region has been clarified considerably.

      We present the reduced basis method as a tool for developing emulators for equations with tunable parameters within the context of the nuclear

      formalism of reduced basis methods and show how these methods can be applied to a broad set of problems. As we illustrate, the possible success 
      of the formalism on such problems can be diagnosed beforehand by a principal component analysis. We apply the reduced basis method to the 
      one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a harmonic trapping potential and to nuclear density functional theory for 48Ca, achieving 
      speed-ups of more than ×150 and ×250, respectively, when compared to traditional solvers. The outstanding performance of the approach, together

  image: bmm_toy_model.png
  description: >
      Bayesian model mixing (BMM) is a statistical technique that can be used to combine models that are predictive in different input domains into a composite distribution that has improved predictive power over the entire input space. We explore the application of BMM to the mixing of two expansions of a function of a coupling constant g that are valid at small and large values of g respectively. This type of problem is quite common in nuclear physics, where physical properties are straightforwardly calculable in strong and weak interaction limits or at low and high densities or momentum transfers, but difficult to calculate in between. Interpolation between these limits is often accomplished by a suitable interpolating function, e.g., Padé approximants, but it is then unclear how to quantify the uncertainty of the interpolant. We address this problem in the simple context of the partition function of zero-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory, for which the (asymptotic) expansion at small g and the (convergent) expansion at large g are both known. We consider three mixing methods: linear mixture BMM, localized bivariate BMM, and localized multivariate BMM with Gaussian processes. We find that employing a Gaussian process in the intermediate region between the two predictive models leads to the best results of the three methods. The methods and validation strategies we present here should be generalizable to other nuclear physics settings.

    Bayesian analysis of energy-level data in several nuclei. The error model in our Bayesian analysis includes both experimental 
    and EFT truncation uncertainties. It also accounts for the fact that low-energy constants (LECs) at even and odd orders have 
    different sizes. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to explore the joint posterior of the EFT and error-model parameters and show both can be 
    reliably determined. We extract the LECs up to fourth order in the EFT and find that, provided we correctly account for EFT truncation errors, 
    results for lower-order LECs are stable as we go to higher orders. LEC results are also stable with respect to the addition of
    higher-energy data. We find a clear correlation between the extracted and the expected value of the inverse breakdown scale. 
    The EFT turns out to converge markedly better than would be naively expected based on the scales of the problem

         State-of-the-art hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions have considerable theoretical model uncertainties in the description of the 
         very early pre-hydrodynamic stage. We add a new computational module, KTIso, that describes the pre-hydrodynamic evolution kinetically, 
         based on the relativistic Boltzmann equation with collisions treated in the Isotropization Time Approximation. As a novelty, KTIso allows 
         for the inclusion and evolution of initial-state momentum anisotropies. To maintain computational efficiency KTIso assumes strict 
         longitudinal boost invariance and allows collisions to isotropize only the transverse momenta. We use it to explore the sensitivity 
         of hadronic observables measured in relativistic heavy-ion collisions to initial-state momentum anisotropies and microscopic scattering 
         during the pre-hydrodynamic stage.

  description: >
      Correlations driven by the constraints of local charge conservationprovide insight into the chemical evolution and diffusivity
      of the high-temperature matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. Two-particle correlations driven by final-state interactions
      have allowed the extraction of critical femtoscopic space-time information about the expansion and dissolution of the same collisions. As first
      steps toward a Bayesian analysis of charge-balance functions, this study quantifies the contribution from final-state interactions, which needs to
      be subtracted in order to quantitatively infer the diffusivity and chemical evolution of the QGP. As seen in the figure, the correction from
      final-state interactions is small.

- title: "Nudged elastic band approach to nuclear fission pathways"
  image: NEBfission.png
  description: >
        The nuclear fission process is a dramatic example of the large-amplitude collective motion in which the nucleus undergoes a series of shape changes
        before splitting into distinct fragments. This motion can be represented by a pathway in the many-dimensional space of collective coordinates. Within 
        a stationary framework rooted in a static collective Schrödinger equation, the collective action along the fission pathway determines the spontaneous 
        fission half-lives as well as mass and charge distributions of fission fragments. We study the performance and precision of various methods to 
        determine the minimum-action and minimum-energy fission trajectories in two- and three-dimensional collective spaces. These methods include the nudged 
        elastic band method (NEB), grid-based methods, and the Euler-Lagrange approach to the collective action minimization. The NEB method is capable of 
        efficient determination of the exit points on the outer turning surface that characterize the most probable fission pathway and constitute the key 
        input for fission studies. The NEB method will be particularly useful in large-scale static fission calculations of superheavy nuclei and neutron-rich 
        fissioning nuclei contributing to the astrophysical r-process recycling.

  description: > 
        We treat low-energy 3He-alpha elastic scattering  in an Effective Field Theory (EFT) that exploits the separation of scales in this reaction. 
        We compute the amplitude up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO), developing a hierarchy of the effective-range parameters that contribute 
        at various orders. We use the resulting formalism to analyze data for recent measurements at center-of-mass energies of 0.38-3.12 MeV using the 
        SONIK gas target at TRIUMF as well as older data in this energy regime. We employ a likelihood function that incorporates the theoretical 
        uncertainty due to truncation of the EFT and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to obtain the resulting posterior probability distribution. 
        We find that the inclusion of a small amount of data on the analysing power $A_y$ is crucial to determine the sign of the p-wave splitting in 
        such an analysis. The combination of Ay and SONIK data constrains all effective-range parameters up to O(p^4) in both s- and p-waves quite well. 
        The ANCs and s-wave scattering length are consistent with a recent EFT analysis of the capture reaction 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be.

- title: "Black Box Variational Bayesian Model Averaging"
  image: VBMAPredictiveCoverage.png
  description: >
        For many decades now, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) has been a popular framework to systematically account for model uncertainty 
        that arises in situations when multiple competing models are available to describe the same or similar physical process. The implementation 
        of this framework, however, comes with a multitude of practical challenges including posterior approximation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
        and numerical integration. We present a Variational Bayesian Inference approach to BMA as a viable alternative to the standard solutions 
        which avoids many of the aforementioned pitfalls. The proposed method is “black box” in the sense that it can be readily applied to many 
        models with little to no model-specific derivation. We illustrate the utility of our variational approach on a suite of examples and discuss 
        all the necessary implementation details. Fully documented Python code with all the examples is provided as well.

  description: >
         Measurements from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) can be used to study the properties
         of quark-gluon plasma. Systematic constraints on these properties must combine measurements from different collision systems and methodically 
         account for experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Such studies require a vast number of costly numerical simulations. While computationally 
         inexpensive surrogate models ("emulators") can be used to efficiently approximate the predictions of heavy ion simulations across a broad range of
         model parameters, training a reliable emulator remains a computationally expensive task. We use transfer learning to map the parameter dependencies
         of one model emulator onto another, leveraging similarities between different simulations of heavy ion collisions. By limiting the need for large 
         numbers of simulations to only one of the emulators, this technique reduces the numerical cost of comprehensive uncertainty quantification when 
         studying multiple collision systems and exploring different models.

- title: "Statistical tools for a better optical model"
  image: 48CaSensitivities.png
  description: >
         Modern statistical tools provide the ability to compare the information content of observables and 
         provide a path to explore which experiments would be most useful to give insight into and constrain theoretical models.
         In this work we study three such tools, (i) the principal component analysis, (ii) the sensitivity analysis based on derivatives, 
         and (iii) the Bayesian evidence. This is done in the context of nuclear reactions with the goal of constraining the optical potential.
         We first apply these tools to a toy-model case. Then we consider two different reaction observables, elastic angular distributions
         and polarization data for reactions on 48Ca and 208Pb at two different beam energies. For the toy-model case, we find significant 
         discrimination power in the sensitivities and the Bayesian evidence, showing clearly that the volume imaginary term is more useful 
         to describe scattering at higher energies. When comparing between elastic cross sections and polarization data using realistic optical 
         models, sensitivity studies indicate that both observables are roughly equally sensitive but the variability of the optical model 
         parameters is strongly angle dependent. The Bayesian evidence shows some variability between the two observables, but the Bayes factor 
         obtained is not sufficient to discriminate between angular distributions and polarization.

  description: >
         We explore the constraints on the three-nucleon force (3NF) of chiral effective field theory (ChiEFT)
         that are provided by bound-state observables in the A=3 and A=4 sectors. Our statistically rigorous 
         analysis incorporates experimental error, computational method uncertainty, and the uncertainty due to 
         truncation of the ChiEFT expansion at next-to-next-to-leading order. A consistent solution for the 
         3H binding energy, the 4He binding energy and radius, and the 3H beta-decay rate can only be obtained if 
         ChiEFT truncation errors are included in the analysis. The beta-decay rate is the only one of these that 
         yields a nondegenerate constraint on the 3NF low-energy constants, which makes it crucial for the parameter 
         estimation. We use eigenvector continuation for fast and accurate emulation of no-core shell model 
         calculations of the few-nucleon observables. This facilitates sampling of the posterior probability 
         distribution, allowing us to also determine the distributions of the parameters that quantify the truncation error. 
         We find a ChiEFT expansion parameter of Q=0.33 ± 0.06 for these observables.

  image: 80ZrBMAEDFs.png
  description: >
        Protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus move in shells analogous to the electronic shell structures of atoms. 
        The nuclear shell structure varies as a result of changes in the nuclear mean field with the number of neutrons N 
        and protons Z, and these variations can be probed by measuring the mass differences between nuclei. The N = Z = 40 
        self-conjugate nucleus 80Zr is of particular interest, as its proton and neutron shell structures are expected to 
        be very similar, and its ground state is highly deformed. Here we provide evidence for the existence of a deformed 
        double-shell closure in 80Zr through high-precision Penning trap mass measurements of 80–83Zr. Our mass values show 
        that 80Zr is substantially lighter, and thus more strongly bound than predicted. This can be attributed to the 
        deformed shell closure at N = Z = 40 and the large Wigner energy. A statistical Bayesian-model mixing analysis 
        employing several global nuclear mass models demonstrates difficulties with reproducing the observed mass anomaly 
        using current theory.

    A microscopic description of the interaction of atomic nuclei with external electroweak probes is required for elucidating

    quantum Monte Carlo methods infer the nuclear electroweak response functions from their Laplace transforms. Inverting the 
    Laplace transform is a notoriously ill-posed problem; and Bayesian techniques, such as maximum entropy, are typically used 
    to reconstruct the original response functions in the quasielastic region. In this work, we present a physics-informed 
    artificial neural network architecture suitable for approximating the inverse of the Laplace transform. Utilizing simulated, 
    albeit realistic, electromagnetic response functions, we show that this physics-informed artificial neural network outperforms 
    maximum entropy in both the low-energy transfer and the quasielastic regions, thereby allowing for robust calculations of 
    electron scattering and neutrino scattering on nuclei and inclusive muon capture rates.
