  image: flowchart_tikz_paper_truncated.png
  description: >
    We describe the Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) framework, 
    a cyberinfrastructure that we are developing which will unify the treatment of nuclear models, 
    experimental data, and associated uncertainties. 
    We overview the statistical principles and nuclear-physics contexts underlying the BAND toolset,
    with an emphasis on Bayesian methodology's ability to leverage insight from multiple models. 
    In order to facilitate understanding of these tools we provide a simple and accessible example of the BAND framework's application. 
    Four case studies are presented to highlight how elements of the framework will enable progress on complex, far-ranging problems in nuclear physics. 
    By collecting notation and terminology, providing illustrative examples, and giving an overview of the associated techniques, 
    this paper aims to open paths through which the nuclear physics and statistics communities can contribute to and build upon the BAND framework.

- title: "Machine-Learning-Based Inversion of Nuclear Responses"
  image: bestworstresponse6.png
  description: >
    A microscopic description of the interaction of atomic nuclei with external electroweak probes is required for elucidating 
    aspects of short-range nuclear dynamics and for the correct interpretation of neutrino oscillation experiments. Nuclear 
    quantum Monte Carlo methods infer the nuclear electroweak response functions from their Laplace transforms. Inverting the 
    Laplace transform is a notoriously ill-posed problem; and Bayesian techniques, such as maximum entropy, are typically used 
    to reconstruct the original response functions in the quasielastic region. In this work, we present a physics-informed 
    artificial neural network architecture suitable for approximating the inverse of the Laplace transform. Utilizing simulated, 
    albeit realistic, electromagnetic response functions, we show that this physics-informed artificial neural network outperforms 
    maximum entropy in both the low-energy transfer and the quasielastic regions, thereby allowing for robust calculations of 
    electron scattering and neutrino scattering on nuclei and inclusive muon capture rates.

    We combine Newton's variational method with ideas from eigenvector continuation to construct a fast & accurate emulator

    interactions that depend smoothly on a set of free parameters. 
    When used to emulate the neutron-proton cross section with a modern chiral interaction as a function of 26 free parameters, 
    it reproduces the exact calculation with negligible error and provides an over 300x improvement in CPU time.

      evaluates an array of Kohn variational principles associated with different boundary conditions, which allows for the detection 
      and removal of spurious singularities known as Kohn anomalies. When applied to the K-matrix only, our emulator resembles the one constructed

      cross sections for 40Ca(n,n) scattering based on a realistic optical potential and quantify the model uncertainties using Bayesian methods. These

  image: 80ZrBMAEDFs.png
  description: >
        Protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus move in shells analogous to the electronic shell structures of atoms. 
        The nuclear shell structure varies as a result of changes in the nuclear mean field with the number of neutrons N 
        and protons Z, and these variations can be probed by measuring the mass differences between nuclei. The N = Z = 40 
        self-conjugate nucleus 80Zr is of particular interest, as its proton and neutron shell structures are expected to 
        be very similar, and its ground state is highly deformed. Here we provide evidence for the existence of a deformed 
        double-shell closure in 80Zr through high-precision Penning trap mass measurements of 80–83Zr. Our mass values show 
        that 80Zr is substantially lighter, and thus more strongly bound than predicted. This can be attributed to the 
        deformed shell closure at N = Z = 40 and the large Wigner energy. A statistical Bayesian-model mixing analysis 
        employing several global nuclear mass models demonstrates difficulties with reproducing the observed mass anomaly 
        using current theory.

  image: Qcbarposterior.png
  description: >
         We explore the constraints on the three-nucleon force (3NF) of chiral effective field theory (ChiEFT)
         that are provided by bound-state observables in the A=3 and A=4 sectors. Our statistically rigorous 
         analysis incorporates experimental error, computational method uncertainty, and the uncertainty due to 
         truncation of the ChiEFT expansion at next-to-next-to-leading order. A consistent solution for the 
         3H binding energy, the 4He binding energy and radius, and the 3H beta-decay rate can only be obtained if 
         ChiEFT truncation errors are included in the analysis. The beta-decay rate is the only one of these that 
         yields a nondegenerate constraint on the 3NF low-energy constants, which makes it crucial for the parameter 
         estimation. We use eigenvector continuation for fast and accurate emulation of no-core shell model 
         calculations of the few-nucleon observables. This facilitates sampling of the posterior probability 
         distribution, allowing us to also determine the distributions of the parameters that quantify the truncation error. 
         We find a ChiEFT expansion parameter of Q=0.33 ± 0.06 for these observables.

- title: "Statistical tools for a better optical model"
  image: 48CaSensitivities.png
  description: >
         Modern statistical tools provide the ability to compare the information content of observables and 
         provide a path to explore which experiments would be most useful to give insight into and constrain theoretical models.
         In this work we study three such tools, (i) the principal component analysis, (ii) the sensitivity analysis based on derivatives, 
         and (iii) the Bayesian evidence. This is done in the context of nuclear reactions with the goal of constraining the optical potential.
         We first apply these tools to a toy-model case. Then we consider two different reaction observables, elastic angular distributions
         and polarization data for reactions on 48Ca and 208Pb at two different beam energies. For the toy-model case, we find significant 
         discrimination power in the sensitivities and the Bayesian evidence, showing clearly that the volume imaginary term is more useful 
         to describe scattering at higher energies. When comparing between elastic cross sections and polarization data using realistic optical 
         models, sensitivity studies indicate that both observables are roughly equally sensitive but the variability of the optical model 
         parameters is strongly angle dependent. The Bayesian evidence shows some variability between the two observables, but the Bayes factor 
         obtained is not sufficient to discriminate between angular distributions and polarization.

  description: >
         Measurements from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) can be used to study the properties
         of quark-gluon plasma. Systematic constraints on these properties must combine measurements from different collision systems and methodically 
         account for experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Such studies require a vast number of costly numerical simulations. While computationally 
         inexpensive surrogate models ("emulators") can be used to efficiently approximate the predictions of heavy ion simulations across a broad range of
         model parameters, training a reliable emulator remains a computationally expensive task. We use transfer learning to map the parameter dependencies
         of one model emulator onto another, leveraging similarities between different simulations of heavy ion collisions. By limiting the need for large 
         numbers of simulations to only one of the emulators, this technique reduces the numerical cost of comprehensive uncertainty quantification when 
         studying multiple collision systems and exploring different models.

  description: >
        For many decades now, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) has been a popular framework to systematically account for model uncertainty 
        that arises in situations when multiple competing models are available to describe the same or similar physical process. The implementation 
        of this framework, however, comes with a multitude of practical challenges including posterior approximation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
        and numerical integration. We present a Variational Bayesian Inference approach to BMA as a viable alternative to the standard solutions 
        which avoids many of the aforementioned pitfalls. The proposed method is “black box” in the sense that it can be readily applied to many 
        models with little to no model-specific derivation. We illustrate the utility of our variational approach on a suite of examples and discuss 
        all the necessary implementation details. Fully documented Python code with all the examples is provided as well.

        We treat low-energy 3He-alpha elastic scattering  in an Effective Field Theory (EFT) that exploits the separation of scales in this reaction. 
        We compute the amplitude up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO), developing a hierarchy of the effective-range parameters that contribute 
        at various orders. We use the resulting formalism to analyze data for recent measurements at center-of-mass energies of 0.38-3.12 MeV using the 
        SONIK gas target at TRIUMF as well as older data in this energy regime. We employ a likelihood function that incorporates the theoretical 
        uncertainty due to truncation of the EFT and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to obtain the resulting posterior probability distribution. 
        We find that the inclusion of a small amount of data on the analysing power $A_y$ is crucial to determine the sign of the p-wave splitting in 
        such an analysis. The combination of Ay and SONIK data constrains all effective-range parameters up to O(p^4) in both s- and p-waves quite well.

- title: "Nudged elastic band approach to nuclear fission pathways"
  image: NEBfission.png
  description: >
        The nuclear fission process is a dramatic example of the large-amplitude collective motion in which the nucleus undergoes a series of shape changes
        before splitting into distinct fragments. This motion can be represented by a pathway in the many-dimensional space of collective coordinates. Within 
        a stationary framework rooted in a static collective Schrödinger equation, the collective action along the fission pathway determines the spontaneous 
        fission half-lives as well as mass and charge distributions of fission fragments. We study the performance and precision of various methods to 
        determine the minimum-action and minimum-energy fission trajectories in two- and three-dimensional collective spaces. These methods include the nudged 
        elastic band method (NEB), grid-based methods, and the Euler-Lagrange approach to the collective action minimization. The NEB method is capable of 
        efficient determination of the exit points on the outer turning surface that characterize the most probable fission pathway and constitute the key 
        input for fission studies. The NEB method will be particularly useful in large-scale static fission calculations of superheavy nuclei and neutron-rich 
        fissioning nuclei contributing to the astrophysical r-process recycling.

    We use a recently developed Effective Field Theory (EFT) for rotational bands in odd-mass nuclei to perform a 
    Bayesian analysis of energy-level data in several nuclei. The error model in our Bayesian analysis includes both experimental 
    and EFT truncation uncertainties. It also accounts for the fact that low-energy constants (LECs) at even and odd orders have 
    different sizes. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to explore the joint posterior of the EFT and error-model parameters and show both can be 
    reliably determined. We extract the LECs up to fourth order in the EFT and find that, provided we correctly account for EFT truncation errors, 
    results for lower-order LECs are stable as we go to higher orders. LEC results are also stable with respect to the addition of
    higher-energy data. We find a clear correlation between the extracted and the expected value of the inverse breakdown scale. 
    The EFT turns out to converge markedly better than would be naively expected based on the scales of the problem

- title: "Interpolating between small- and large-g expansions using Bayesian model mixing"
  image: bmm_toy_model.png
  description: >
      Bayesian model mixing (BMM) is a statistical technique that can be used to combine models that are predictive in different input domains into a composite distribution that has improved predictive power over the entire input space. We explore the application of BMM to the mixing of two expansions of a function of a coupling constant g that are valid at small and large values of g respectively. This type of problem is quite common in nuclear physics, where physical properties are straightforwardly calculable in strong and weak interaction limits or at low and high densities or momentum transfers, but difficult to calculate in between. Interpolation between these limits is often accomplished by a suitable interpolating function, e.g., Padé approximants, but it is then unclear how to quantify the uncertainty of the interpolant. We address this problem in the simple context of the partition function of zero-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory, for which the (asymptotic) expansion at small g and the (convergent) expansion at large g are both known. We consider three mixing methods: linear mixture BMM, localized bivariate BMM, and localized multivariate BMM with Gaussian processes. We find that employing a Gaussian process in the intermediate region between the two predictive models leads to the best results of the three methods. The methods and validation strategies we present here should be generalizable to other nuclear physics settings.

- title: "Towards precise and accurate calculations of neutrinoless double-beta decay"
  image: Ca48_M0v.png
  description: >
      We present the results of a National Science Foundation Project Scoping Workshop, the purpose of which was to assess the current status of 
      calculations for the nuclear matrix elements governing neutrinoless double-beta decay and determine if more work on them is required. After 
      reviewing important recent progress in the application of effective field theory, lattice quantum chromodynamics, and ab initio nuclear-structure 
      theory to double-beta decay, we discuss the state of the art in nuclear-physics uncertainty quantification and then construct a 
      roadmap for work in all these areas to fully complement the increasingly sensitive experiments in operation and under development. The roadmap 
      includes specific projects in theoretical and computational physics as well as the use of Bayesian methods to quantify both intra- and inter-model 
      uncertainties. The goal of this ambitious program is a set of accurate and precise matrix elements, in all nuclei of interest to experimentalists, 
      delivered together with carefully assessed uncertainties. Such calculations will allow crisp conclusions from the observation or non-observation of 
      neutrinoless double-beta decay, no matter what new physics is at play.
