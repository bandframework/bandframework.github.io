  image: flowchart_tikz_paper_truncated.png
  description: >
    We describe the Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) framework, 
    a cyberinfrastructure that we are developing which will unify the treatment of nuclear models, 
    experimental data, and associated uncertainties. 
    We overview the statistical principles and nuclear-physics contexts underlying the BAND toolset,
    with an emphasis on Bayesian methodology's ability to leverage insight from multiple models. 
    In order to facilitate understanding of these tools we provide a simple and accessible example of the BAND framework's application. 
    Four case studies are presented to highlight how elements of the framework will enable progress on complex, far-ranging problems in nuclear physics. 
    By collecting notation and terminology, providing illustrative examples, and giving an overview of the associated techniques, 
    this paper aims to open paths through which the nuclear physics and statistics communities can contribute to and build upon the BAND framework.

- title: "Machine-Learning-Based Inversion of Nuclear Responses"
  image: bestworstresponse6.png
  description: >
    A microscopic description of the interaction of atomic nuclei with external electroweak probes is required for elucidating 
    aspects of short-range nuclear dynamics and for the correct interpretation of neutrino oscillation experiments. Nuclear 
    quantum Monte Carlo methods infer the nuclear electroweak response functions from their Laplace transforms. Inverting the 
    Laplace transform is a notoriously ill-posed problem; and Bayesian techniques, such as maximum entropy, are typically used 
    to reconstruct the original response functions in the quasielastic region. In this work, we present a physics-informed 
    artificial neural network architecture suitable for approximating the inverse of the Laplace transform. Utilizing simulated, 
    albeit realistic, electromagnetic response functions, we show that this physics-informed artificial neural network outperforms 
    maximum entropy in both the low-energy transfer and the quasielastic regions, thereby allowing for robust calculations of 
    electron scattering and neutrino scattering on nuclei and inclusive muon capture rates.

    We combine Newton's variational method with ideas from eigenvector continuation to construct a fast & accurate emulator

    interactions that depend smoothly on a set of free parameters. 
    When used to emulate the neutron-proton cross section with a modern chiral interaction as a function of 26 free parameters, 
    it reproduces the exact calculation with negligible error and provides an over 300x improvement in CPU time.

      evaluates an array of Kohn variational principles associated with different boundary conditions, which allows for the detection 
      and removal of spurious singularities known as Kohn anomalies. When applied to the K-matrix only, our emulator resembles the one constructed

      cross sections for 40Ca(n,n) scattering based on a realistic optical potential and quantify the model uncertainties using Bayesian methods. These

  image: 80ZrBMAEDFs.png
  description: >
        Protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus move in shells analogous to the electronic shell structures of atoms. 
        The nuclear shell structure varies as a result of changes in the nuclear mean field with the number of neutrons N 
        and protons Z, and these variations can be probed by measuring the mass differences between nuclei. The N = Z = 40 
        self-conjugate nucleus 80Zr is of particular interest, as its proton and neutron shell structures are expected to 
        be very similar, and its ground state is highly deformed. Here we provide evidence for the existence of a deformed 
        double-shell closure in 80Zr through high-precision Penning trap mass measurements of 80–83Zr. Our mass values show 
        that 80Zr is substantially lighter, and thus more strongly bound than predicted. This can be attributed to the 
        deformed shell closure at N = Z = 40 and the large Wigner energy. A statistical Bayesian-model mixing analysis 
        employing several global nuclear mass models demonstrates difficulties with reproducing the observed mass anomaly 
        using current theory.

  image: Qcbarposterior.png
  description: >
         We explore the constraints on the three-nucleon force (3NF) of chiral effective field theory (ChiEFT)
         that are provided by bound-state observables in the A=3 and A=4 sectors. Our statistically rigorous 
         analysis incorporates experimental error, computational method uncertainty, and the uncertainty due to 
         truncation of the ChiEFT expansion at next-to-next-to-leading order. A consistent solution for the 
         3H binding energy, the 4He binding energy and radius, and the 3H beta-decay rate can only be obtained if 
         ChiEFT truncation errors are included in the analysis. The beta-decay rate is the only one of these that 
         yields a nondegenerate constraint on the 3NF low-energy constants, which makes it crucial for the parameter 
         estimation. We use eigenvector continuation for fast and accurate emulation of no-core shell model 
         calculations of the few-nucleon observables. This facilitates sampling of the posterior probability 
         distribution, allowing us to also determine the distributions of the parameters that quantify the truncation error. 
         We find a ChiEFT expansion parameter of Q=0.33 ± 0.06 for these observables.

- title: "Statistical tools for a better optical model"
  image: 48CaSensitivities.png
  description: >
         Modern statistical tools provide the ability to compare the information content of observables and 
         provide a path to explore which experiments would be most useful to give insight into and constrain theoretical models.
         In this work we study three such tools, (i) the principal component analysis, (ii) the sensitivity analysis based on derivatives, 
         and (iii) the Bayesian evidence. This is done in the context of nuclear reactions with the goal of constraining the optical potential.
         We first apply these tools to a toy-model case. Then we consider two different reaction observables, elastic angular distributions
         and polarization data for reactions on 48Ca and 208Pb at two different beam energies. For the toy-model case, we find significant 
         discrimination power in the sensitivities and the Bayesian evidence, showing clearly that the volume imaginary term is more useful 
         to describe scattering at higher energies. When comparing between elastic cross sections and polarization data using realistic optical 
         models, sensitivity studies indicate that both observables are roughly equally sensitive but the variability of the optical model 
         parameters is strongly angle dependent. The Bayesian evidence shows some variability between the two observables, but the Bayes factor 
         obtained is not sufficient to discriminate between angular distributions and polarization.

  description: >
         Measurements from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) can be used to study the properties
         of quark-gluon plasma. Systematic constraints on these properties must combine measurements from different collision systems and methodically 
         account for experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Such studies require a vast number of costly numerical simulations. While computationally 
         inexpensive surrogate models ("emulators") can be used to efficiently approximate the predictions of heavy ion simulations across a broad range of
         model parameters, training a reliable emulator remains a computationally expensive task. We use transfer learning to map the parameter dependencies
         of one model emulator onto another, leveraging similarities between different simulations of heavy ion collisions. By limiting the need for large 
         numbers of simulations to only one of the emulators, this technique reduces the numerical cost of comprehensive uncertainty quantification when 
         studying multiple collision systems and exploring different models.

  description: >
        For many decades now, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) has been a popular framework to systematically account for model uncertainty 
        that arises in situations when multiple competing models are available to describe the same or similar physical process. The implementation 
        of this framework, however, comes with a multitude of practical challenges including posterior approximation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
        and numerical integration. We present a Variational Bayesian Inference approach to BMA as a viable alternative to the standard solutions 
        which avoids many of the aforementioned pitfalls. The proposed method is “black box” in the sense that it can be readily applied to many 
        models with little to no model-specific derivation. We illustrate the utility of our variational approach on a suite of examples and discuss 
        all the necessary implementation details. Fully documented Python code with all the examples is provided as well.

        We treat low-energy 3He-alpha elastic scattering  in an Effective Field Theory (EFT) that exploits the separation of scales in this reaction. 
        We compute the amplitude up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO), developing a hierarchy of the effective-range parameters that contribute 
        at various orders. We use the resulting formalism to analyze data for recent measurements at center-of-mass energies of 0.38-3.12 MeV using the 
        SONIK gas target at TRIUMF as well as older data in this energy regime. We employ a likelihood function that incorporates the theoretical 
        uncertainty due to truncation of the EFT and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to obtain the resulting posterior probability distribution. 
        We find that the inclusion of a small amount of data on the analysing power $A_y$ is crucial to determine the sign of the p-wave splitting in 
        such an analysis. The combination of Ay and SONIK data constrains all effective-range parameters up to O(p^4) in both s- and p-waves quite well.

- title: "Nudged elastic band approach to nuclear fission pathways"
  image: NEBfission.png
  description: >
        The nuclear fission process is a dramatic example of the large-amplitude collective motion in which the nucleus undergoes a series of shape changes
        before splitting into distinct fragments. This motion can be represented by a pathway in the many-dimensional space of collective coordinates. Within 
        a stationary framework rooted in a static collective Schrödinger equation, the collective action along the fission pathway determines the spontaneous 
        fission half-lives as well as mass and charge distributions of fission fragments. We study the performance and precision of various methods to 
        determine the minimum-action and minimum-energy fission trajectories in two- and three-dimensional collective spaces. These methods include the nudged 
        elastic band method (NEB), grid-based methods, and the Euler-Lagrange approach to the collective action minimization. The NEB method is capable of 
        efficient determination of the exit points on the outer turning surface that characterize the most probable fission pathway and constitute the key 
        input for fission studies. The NEB method will be particularly useful in large-scale static fission calculations of superheavy nuclei and neutron-rich 
        fissioning nuclei contributing to the astrophysical r-process recycling.

    We use a recently developed Effective Field Theory (EFT) for rotational bands in odd-mass nuclei to perform a 
    Bayesian analysis of energy-level data in several nuclei. The error model in our Bayesian analysis includes both experimental 
    and EFT truncation uncertainties. It also accounts for the fact that low-energy constants (LECs) at even and odd orders have 
    different sizes. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to explore the joint posterior of the EFT and error-model parameters and show both can be 
    reliably determined. We extract the LECs up to fourth order in the EFT and find that, provided we correctly account for EFT truncation errors, 
    results for lower-order LECs are stable as we go to higher orders. LEC results are also stable with respect to the addition of
    higher-energy data. We find a clear correlation between the extracted and the expected value of the inverse breakdown scale. 
    The EFT turns out to converge markedly better than would be naively expected based on the scales of the problem

- title: "Interpolating between small- and large-g expansions using Bayesian model mixing"
  image: bmm_toy_model.png
  description: >
      Bayesian model mixing (BMM) is a statistical technique that can be used to combine models that are predictive in different input domains into a composite distribution that has improved predictive power over the entire input space. We explore the application of BMM to the mixing of two expansions of a function of a coupling constant g that are valid at small and large values of g respectively. This type of problem is quite common in nuclear physics, where physical properties are straightforwardly calculable in strong and weak interaction limits or at low and high densities or momentum transfers, but difficult to calculate in between. Interpolation between these limits is often accomplished by a suitable interpolating function, e.g., Padé approximants, but it is then unclear how to quantify the uncertainty of the interpolant. We address this problem in the simple context of the partition function of zero-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory, for which the (asymptotic) expansion at small g and the (convergent) expansion at large g are both known. We consider three mixing methods: linear mixture BMM, localized bivariate BMM, and localized multivariate BMM with Gaussian processes. We find that employing a Gaussian process in the intermediate region between the two predictive models leads to the best results of the three methods. The methods and validation strategies we present here should be generalizable to other nuclear physics settings.

  image: Ca48_M0v.png
  description: >
      We present the results of a National Science Foundation Project Scoping Workshop, the purpose of which was to assess the current status of 
      calculations for the nuclear matrix elements governing neutrinoless double-beta decay and determine if more work on them is required. After 
      reviewing important recent progress in the application of effective field theory, lattice quantum chromodynamics, and ab initio nuclear-structure 
      theory to double-beta decay, we discuss the state of the art in nuclear-physics uncertainty quantification and then construct a 
      roadmap for work in all these areas to fully complement the increasingly sensitive experiments in operation and under development. The roadmap 
      includes specific projects in theoretical and computational physics as well as the use of Bayesian methods to quantify both intra- and inter-model 
      uncertainties. The goal of this ambitious program is a set of accurate and precise matrix elements, in all nuclei of interest to experimentalists, 
      delivered together with carefully assessed uncertainties. Such calculations will allow crisp conclusions from the observation or non-observation of 
      neutrinoless double-beta decay, no matter what new physics is at play.

- title: "Training and projecting: A reduced basis method emulator for many-body physics"
  image: RBMs.png
  description: >
      We present the reduced basis method as a tool for developing emulators for equations with tunable parameters within the context of the nuclear 
      many-body problem. The method uses a basis expansion informed by a set of solutions for a few values of the model parameters and then projects 
      the equations over a well-chosen low-dimensional subspace. We connect some of the results in the eigenvector continuation literature to the 
      formalism of reduced basis methods and show how these methods can be applied to a broad set of problems. As we illustrate, the possible success 
      of the formalism on such problems can be diagnosed beforehand by a principal component analysis. We apply the reduced basis method to the 
      one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a harmonic trapping potential and to nuclear density functional theory for 48Ca, achieving 
      speed-ups of more than ×150 and ×250, respectively, when compared to traditional solvers. The outstanding performance of the approach, together 
      with its straightforward implementation, show promise for its application to the emulation of computationally demanding calculations, including 
      uncertainty quantification.

- title: "Investigation of the 10B(p,α)7Be reaction from 0.8 to 2.0 MeV"
  image: brick.jpg
  description: >
    A multitude of broad interfering resonances characterize the 10B(p,α)7Be
    cross section at low energies. The complexity of the reaction mechanism, as
    well as conflicting experimental measurements, have so far prevented a
    reliable prediction of the cross section over the energy ranges pertinent
    for a boron-proton fusion reactor environment. Purpose: To improve the
    evaluated cross section of the 10B(p,α)7Be reaction, this study
    targets the proton energy region from 0.8 to 2.0 MeV, where kinematic
    overlap of the scattered protons and reaction α particles have made past
    measurements very challenging. Method: New detailed studies of the reaction
    have been performed at the Edwards Accelerator Laboratory at Ohio University
    and the Nuclear Science Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame using
    time-of-flight and degrader foil techniques, respectively. Results: Proton
    and α -particle signals were clearly resolved using both techniques, and 16
    point differential cross sections were measured over an angular range of θ
    lab = 45º and 157.5º. A comprehensive R-matrix analysis of the
    experimental data, including data from previous low-energy studies of the
    10B(p,α)7Be, 10B(p,p)10B, and 10B(p,γ)11C reactions, was achieved over
    the region of measurement. Using a representative set of previous data, the
    fit was extended to very low energies.
    Conclusions: On the basis of this
    data and R-matrix analysis, a more reliable and consistent description of
    the 10B(p,α)7Be cross section has been established. The uncertainty
    over the energy range of this study has been reduced from ≈20 % to ≈10 %,
    and the level structure over this region has been clarified considerably.

  image: brick.jpg
  description: >
    The 23 Na (p,γ)24Mg reaction plays an important role in the
    nucleosynthesis of elements in the hot bottom burning environment of
    asymptotic giant branch stars by providing a breakout path from the NeNa
    cycle to the MgAl cycle. At temperatures above ≈ 0.06 GK, the underlying
    nuclear reaction contributions to the rate are primarily narrow resonances,
    but at lower temperatures direct and broad resonance tail contributions come
    to dominate. While there have been recent studies to improve the
    uncertainties associated with these narrow resonances, little attention has
    been paid to the nonresonant component. In this work, experimental
    measurements are reported over the energy range from 0.5 and 1.05 MeV proton
    beam energy, with a focus on studying the off-resonance region of the cross
    section. Several transitions were observed where two broad resonances
    dominate the energy range and whose low energy tails contribute strongly to
    the low-energy, nonresonant, cross section. In addition, a clear signature
    of direct capture has been observed for the first time in the 23Na(p,γ)24Mg
    reaction.

- title: "Measurement of 19F(p, γ)20Ne reaction suggests CNO breakout in first stars"
  image: brick.jpg
  description: >
    Proposed mechanisms for the production of calcium in the first stars
    that formed out of the matter of the Big Bang are at odds with observations. Advanced nuclear burning and
    supernovae were thought to be the dominant source of the calcium production
    seen in all stars. Here we suggest a qualitatively different path to
    calcium production: breakout from the ‘warm’ carbon–nitrogen–oxygen
    (CNO) cycle. We report a direct experimental measurement of the 19F(p, γ)20Ne
    breakout reaction down to a very low energy of 186 kiloelectronvolts,
    and characterize a key resonance at 225 kiloelectronvolts. For temperatures of
    astrophysical interest--around 0.1 gigakelvin--this thermonuclear
    19F(p, γ)20Ne rate is roughly a factor of seven larger than the previously
    recommended one. Our stellar models show a stronger breakout during
    stellar hydrogen burning than previously thought and may reveal the
    nature of calcium production in population III stars imprinted on the oldest
    known ultra-iron-poor star, SMSS0313-67086. This experimental result was
    obtained in the China JinPing Underground Laboratory7, which offers an
    environment with an extremely low cosmic-ray-induced background. Our rate
    showcases the effect that faint population III star supernovae can have on
    the nucleosynthesis observed in the oldest known stars and first galaxies,
    which are key mission targets of the James Webb Space Telescope.

  description: >
    Fluorine is one of the most interesting elements in nuclear astrophysics.
    The 19F(p,α)16O reaction is of astrophysical importance in
    addressing fluorine abundances in the universe and CNO material loss in the
    first generation stars. As a day-1 campaign in the Jinping Underground
    Nuclear Astrophysics experiment facility (JUNA), we report the full direct
    measurement results of the 19F(p,αγ)16O reaction, which is one of
    the important channels in the 19F(p,α)16O reaction. The γ-ray
    yields were measured over a center-of-mass energy range of Ec.m.=72.4–344
    keV, covering the astrophysical Gamow window. The measurement has reached
    down to an unprecedentedly low energy of 72.4 keV. The experiment was
    performed under the extremely low cosmic-ray-induced background environment
    of the China JinPing underground Laboratory (CJPL), one of the deepest
    underground laboratories in the world (2400 m). The astrophysical S factors
    in the energy region of 72.4–188.8 keV have been derived experimentally for
    the first time. The present low-energy astrophysical S factors deviate
    significantly from previous theoretical predictions, and the associated
    uncertainties are remarkably reduced. The thermonuclear 19F(p,αγ)16O rate
    has been determined down to a low temperature of ≈ 0.05 GK, for
    astrophysical modeling, based on a firmer experimental basis.  Furthermore,
    the present work shows that the contribution owing to the (p,α0)
    channel dominates the total (p,α) rate over the entire low temperature
    region below 0.12 GK, clarifying the role these two channels contributing to
    the total rate.

  image: brick.jpg
  description: >
    The modeling of background sources in large volume detection systems
    requires accurate nuclear cross sections for a variety of reactions. Among
    the most important are ( α , n ) on light nuclei, where α particles, up to ≈
    9 MeV, are produced from the decay of actinides present in trace amounts in
    detection and structural material. In order to model the neutron energy
    spectra and production of other secondary particles, the partial cross
    sections are needed. Yet very little experimental data exists for these
    partial cross sections because past measurements, hampered by the
    experimental challenges of neutron detection, have focused mostly on total
    reaction cross section measurements. Here the partial cross section of the 
    13 C ( α , n 1 ) 16 O reaction is reported for the first time. The
    measurements were made near the reaction threshold using a high energy
    resolution helium spectrometer. The measurements show a rapidly increasing
    cross section, which quickly becomes a significant fraction of the total
    reaction cross section. Measurements are compared with previous theory
    estimates and differences of more than an order of magnitude are found. A
    comparison is made with new total cross section measurements and the current
    level of consistency is demonstrated.

- title: "Bayes goes fast: Uncertainty quantification for a covariant energy density functional emulated by the reduced basis method"
  image: NonLinearCorrelation.png
  description: >
      A covariant energy density functional is calibrated using a principled Bayesian statistical 
      framework informed by experimental binding energies and charge radii of several magic and 
      semi-magic nuclei. The Bayesian sampling required for the calibration is enabled by the 
      emulation of the high-fidelity model through the implementation of a reduced basis method 
      (RBM)—a set of dimensionality reduction techniques that can speed up demanding calculations 
      involving partial differential equations by several orders of magnitude. The RBM emulator 
      we build—using only 100 evaluations of the high-fidelity model—is able to accurately reproduce 
      the model calculations in tens of milliseconds on a personal computer, an increase in speed of 
      nearly a factor of 3,300 when compared to the original solver. Besides the analysis of the 
      posterior distribution of parameters, we present model calculations for masses and radii 
      with properly estimated uncertainties. We also analyze the model correlation between the 
      slope of the symmetry energy L and the neutron skin of 48Ca and 208Pb. The straightforward 
      implementation and outstanding performance of the RBM makes it an ideal tool for assisting 
      the nuclear theory community in providing reliable estimates with properly quantified 
      uncertainties of physical observables. Such uncertainty quantification tools will become 
      essential given the expected abundance of data from the recently inaugurated and future 
      experimental and observational facilities.

      reliably approximating high-fidelity models. As the general tools employed by these emulators are 
      not yet well-known in the nuclear physics community, we discuss variational and Galerkin projection 
      methods, emphasize the benefits of offline-online decompositions, and explore how these concepts 
      lead to emulators for bound and scattering systems that enable fast and accurate calculations using 
      many different model parameter sets. We also point to future extensions and applications of these 
      emulators for nuclear physics, guided by the mature field of model (order) reduction. All examples

  description: >
      Gaussian process surrogates are a popular alternative to directly using computationally expensive 
      simulation models. When the simulation output consists of many responses, dimension-reduction 
      techniques are often employed to construct these surrogates. However, surrogate methods with dimension 
      reduction generally rely on complete output training data. This article proposes a new Gaussian process 
      surrogate method that permits the use of partially observed output while remaining computationally 
      efficient. The new method involves the imputation of missing values and the adjustment of the 
      covariance matrix used for Gaussian process inference. The resulting surrogate represents the available 
      responses, disregards the missing responses, and provides meaningful uncertainty quantification. The 
      proposed approach is shown to offer sharper inference than alternatives in a simulation study and a 
      case study where an energy density functional model that frequently returns incomplete output is 
      calibrated.

  image: Deblurring.png
  description: >
      In nuclear reaction experiments, the measured decay energy spectra can give insights into the shell structure 
      of decaying systems. However, extracting the underlying physics from the measurements is challenging due to detector
      resolution and acceptance effects. The Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm, a deblurring method that is commonly 
      used in optics and has proven to be a successful technique for restoring images, was applied to our experimental 
      nuclear physics data. The only inputs to the method are the observed energy spectrum and the detector's response
      matrix also known as the transfer matrix. We demonstrate that the technique can help access information about the 
      shell structure of particle-unbound systems from the measured decay energy spectrum that is not immediately
      accessible via traditional approaches such as χ-square fitting. For a similar purpose, we developed a machine learning
      model that uses a deep neural network (DNN) classifier to identify resonance states from the measured decay energy 
      spectrum. We tested the performance of both methods on simulated data and experimental measurements. 
      Then, we applied both algorithms to the decay energy spectrum of 26O→24O+n+n measured via invariant mass spectroscopy. 
      The resonance states restored using the RL algorithm to deblur the measured decay energy spectrum agree with those 
      found by the DNN classifier. Both deblurring and DNN approaches suggest that the raw decay energy spectrum of
      26O exhibits three peaks at approximately 0.15 MeV, 1.50 MeV, and 5.00 MeV, with half-widths of 0.29 MeV, 0.80 MeV, 
      and 1.85 MeV, respectively.

- title: "Sequential Bayesian experimental design for calibration of expensive simulation models"
  image: eivar_cs.png
  description: >
      Simulation models of critical systems often have parameters that need to be calibrated using observed data. 
      For expensive simulation models, calibration is done using an emulator of the simulation model built on simulation 
      output at different parameter settings. Using intelligent and adaptive selection of parameters to build the emulator 
      can drastically improve the efficiency of the calibration process. The article proposes a sequential framework with 
      a novel criterion for parameter selection that targets learning the posterior density of the parameters. The emergent 
      behavior from this criterion is that exploration happens by selecting parameters in uncertain posterior regions while 
      simultaneously exploitation happens by selecting parameters in regions of high posterior density. The advantages of 
      the proposed method are illustrated using several simulation experiments and a nuclear physics reaction model.
