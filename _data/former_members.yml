    Dr. Plumlee studies statistical methodology with a specific focus on uncertainty
    quantification for expensive computational models.  This includes the development
    and deployment of statistical learning tools in high dimensional environments.  
    Statistical procedures of scientific interest include model emulation, parameter
    estimation, discrepancy detection and correction.  Specific interests lie in
    large-scale implementations and well-justified uncertainty quantification of
    estimates.  Within BAND, his role will be in the design, use, and implementation of
    cutting edge statistical tools to solve complicated nuclear physics problems
    n the presence of multiple models.
